      "Prior to the SDGs, countries lacked a standardized method of comparing their development performance with that of their peers across a broad array of development objectives (for example, health, education, climate, ending poverty, reducing inequalities, etc.). Nor did countries have a common language to discuss and share experiences when tackling these development issues. Furthermore, the SDGs have positively impacted discourse and knowledge exchange beyond government officials. Many civil-society and private-sector actors have become SDG-conversant, facilitating greater discourse within countries across government and non-government actors.\n",
