    "Patterns of unsustainable consumption and production persist, with global food waste reaching 1.05 billion metric tons in 2022.",
    "Only 9 of 193 countries included food waste in their nationally determined contributions on climate change actions.",
    "The rapid growth of global e-waste remains largely unaddressed, with only 22 per cent collected and managed sustainably.",
    "Achieving sustainable consumption and production patterns requires fostering circular economy models, sustainable production practices, and responsible consumption.",
    "Robust regulatory frameworks, financial incentives, and public awareness campaigns are necessary to drive progress towards sustainable consumption and production.",
    "Household food waste varies by just 7 kilograms per capita each year across high-income, upper-middle-income, and lower-middle-income countries.",
    "Food loss and waste generate 8 to 10 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, costing over $1 trillion and straining land resources and biodiversity.",
    "Uncontrolled disposal of electronic and electrical equipment fuels vast e-waste stockpiles, exacerbated by rising consumption, short product life cycles, and little repair.",
    "E-waste generation is projected to increase to 10 kilograms per capita per year by 2030, with only 22 per cent collected and managed sustainably.",
    "Boosting collection rates to 60 per cent could prevent 34,000 kilograms of mercury emissions and 209 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions in 2030.",
    "More countries and companies are reporting on sustainability measures, with 62 Member States and the European Union reporting 516 policy instruments from 2019 to 2023.",
    "International standard setters have developed sustainability reporting standards for both the public and private sectors, but challenges persist due to a lack of interoperability and inconsistency in national reporting requirements.",
    "Domestic material consumption growth slows, but regional disparities persist, with a widening gap between regions where the material footprint exceeds domestic material consumption and those where it does not."
