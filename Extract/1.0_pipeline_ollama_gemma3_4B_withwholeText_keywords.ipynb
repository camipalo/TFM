We firmly believe that international cooperation together with the achievement of the SDGs is the best preventative to this dire and growing risk, and represent an opportunity to create positive social tipping points: for example, through equal access to high-quality education (SDG 4), and by fighting all forms of inequalities, including income and wealth inequalities (SDG 10).\n",
      "2. The report’s recommendations include calling for more racially-disaggregated SDG indicators and for dialogue with stakeholders on how to use these indicators to better allocate resources and prioritize the inclusion of marginalized peoples.\n",
      "3. The geopolitical situation today is certainly the most conflictual in decades, perhaps since World War II. The rise of China has led to great tension between it and the United States.\n",

      "Extracted Arguments:\n",
      "1. We need to invest in data and science literacy to strengthen the science-policy interface.\n",
      "2. Non-official sources of statistics, such as citizen science, social media, earth observation data, artificial intelligence (AI), model-based estimates, and other pathways produced by academics and researchers, support greater accountability and can provide a forward-looking evaluation of efforts to implement the SDGs, complementing official statistics.\n",
      "3. Space-based technologies help address data gaps and timeliness, including supporting the ‘leave no one behind’ principle; they can be further leveraged via global partnerships.\n",
      "4. The new SDGs-EYES program will establish ‘an integrated scientific, technological and user engagement framework, overcoming the knowledge and technical barriers that prevent the exploitation, combination and cross-feeding of data and tools’ to support SDG action.\n",
      "5. UN-GGIM and the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) aim to reduce the technical and legal barriers to using geospatial data and to strengthen multistakeholder partnerships.\n",
      "6. TReNDS’ Data for Now initiative is working to support countries’ capacity to deliver robust and timely data to achieve the SDGs through user-centric approach, multistakeholder partnerships, and use of alternative data sources, including space-based technologies.\n"
