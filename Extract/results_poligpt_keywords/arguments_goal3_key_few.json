    "The COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged global health, undoing nearly 10 years of progress in life expectancy.",
    "While most health-related indicators are moving in the right direction globally, current trends are insufficient to meet targets set for 2030.",
    "The maternal mortality ratio is largely stuck at a level more than three times the 2030 target.",
    "Under-5 deaths reached an historic low in 2022, but progress has slowed.",
    "Without accelerated declines, 35 million children will not live to see their fifth birthday by 2030.",
    "The global response to infectious diseases has saved millions of lives and paved the way for healthier communities.",
    "Inequalities and emerging threats jeopardize these accomplishments, however, underscoring the need for sustained efforts and innovative strategies.",
    "More than half the world’s population is not covered by essential health services, while an ageing health workforce must now meet growing demands from an ageing population.",
    "Ensuring universal health coverage without financial hardship is crucial to healthy lives and well-being for all.",
    "The world is not on track to achieve Goal 3.",
    "Changing course requires prioritizing the achievement of universal health coverage, strengthening health systems, investing in disease prevention and treatment, and addressing disparities in access to care and services, especially for vulnerable populations.",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected global health, reversing steady progress in life expectancy over the past two decades.",
    "Prior to the pandemic, global life expectancy rose consistently, from 66.8 years in 2000 to 73.1 years in 2019, reflecting years of improvements in health and related areas.",
    "COVID-19 swiftly reversed this positive trend, with global life expectancy plummeting to 71.4 years by 2021, back to the level of 2012.",
    "Before the pandemic, non-communicable diseases had been steadily increasing as the leading cause of death, accounting for 59.5 per cent of all deaths in 2000 and 73.9 per cent in 2019.",
    "The share of communicable diseases dropped from 32.2 per cent in 2000 to 18.2 per cent in 2019.",
    "As COVID-19 emerged as a new infectious disease and started to take a toll on human lives, the share of deaths due to communicable diseases jumped back to the 2005 level (28.1 per cent) in 2021, while the share of deaths due to non-communicable diseases decreased to 65.3 per cent.",
    "COVID-19 ranked among the top three leading causes of death globally in 2020 and 2021, with striking regional variations.",
    "Progress towards universal health coverage has slowed, leaving billions without care and subject to catastrophic costs.",
    "Essential health service coverage is measured using an index, reported on a score of 0 to 100, based on 14 indicators across four domains: reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health; infectious diseases; non-communicable diseases; and service capacity and access.",

    "Per 10,000 people, these countries had medians of only 1.1 medical doctors, 7.5 nursing and midwifery personnel, 0.04 dentists and 0.2 pharmacists, compared with medians in high-income countries of 35.6 medical doctors, 76.8 nursing and midwifery personnel, 7.0 dentists and 8.8 pharmacists.",
    "Health systems are experiencing increased strains in catering to the mounting health needs of an ageing global population, more so because the health workforce itself is ageing.",
    "An estimated 1.8 million additional health workers are needed in 54 countries, primarily high-income ones, to replace retiring health professionals and maintain the current age-standardized density of health workers.",
    "Declines in maternal mortality have stalled, with wide disparities by region and income.",
    "Between 2015 and 2020, the global maternal mortality ratio declined only marginally from 227 to 223 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, over three times higher than the 2030 target of 70.",
    "Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia account for 87 per cent of maternal deaths.",
