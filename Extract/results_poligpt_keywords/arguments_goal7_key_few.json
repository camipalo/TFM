    "Considerable strides have been made in achieving sustainable energy targets.",
    "The number of people lacking access to electricity dropped from 958 million in 2015 to 685 million in 2022.",
    "The number without clean cooking fuels declined from 2.8 billion to 2.1 billion over the same period.",
    "Global capacity to generate electricity from renewable energy has begun expanding at an unprecedented rate, a trend expected to continue.",
    "Recent events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, have disrupted progress, including by exacerbating already insufficient international financial flows for clean energy in developing countries.",
    "Without a change in course, an estimated 660 million people will still lack electricity access and around 1.8 billion will go without clean cooking fuels and technologies by 2030.",
    "To achieve universal access to clean energy by 2030, robust policies are needed to accelerate electrification, enhance energy efficiency and increase investments in renewable energy.",
    "The number of people lacking electricity access grew for the first time in a decade in 2022, although the global electricity access rate held steady at 91 per cent, 685 million people still lacked electricity, 10 million more than in 2021 due to population growth.",
    "Those without access to electricity are predominantly in low-income households or located in remote areas.",
    "Progress varies by region, with Central and Southern Asia reducing the regional gap from 235 million people in 2015 to 33 million in 2022.",
    "Sub-Saharan Africa had a growing share of the global access deficit, at 83 per cent (or 570 million people) in 2022, up from 50 per cent in 2010.",
    "Investing in decentralized renewable energy, including stand-alone off-grid solar and mini-grids, together with electricity-as-a-service models holds significant potential to bridge the access gap.",
    "Without faster progress, by 2030, around 1.8 billion people will still prepare meals using polluting stoves and fuels.",
    "In 2022, 74 per cent of the global population had access to clean cooking, but this still leaves around 2.1 billion people relying on polluting fuels and technologies as their primary energy source for cooking.",
    "A reliance on traditional stoves and polluting fuels worsens health and environmental risks, particularly for women and children, who bear the brunt of cooking and fuel collection burdens.",
    "The share of renewable energy in the worldâ€™s total final energy consumption rose from 16.7 per cent in 2015 to 18.7 per cent in 2021.",
    "Excluding traditional forms of biomass, the share of modern renewable sources climbed gradually from 10 per cent in 2015 to 12.5 per cent in 2021.",
    "The electricity sector has emerged as a frontrunner in adopting wind and solar technologies due to their declining costs.",
    "Renewables constituted over 28.2 per cent of total final energy consumption for electricity in 2021, up from 22.9 per cent in 2015.",
    "Increases in renewable energy use remain constrained in the heating and transport sectors, which account for four fifths of total final energy consumption.",
    "Globally, per capita installed capacity for generating electricity with renewable energy nearly doubled from 250 watts in 2015 to 424 watts in 2022.",
    "Disparities are more evident for the LDCs, LLDCs and small island developing States, which in 2022 achieved 40, 103 and 101 watts per capita, respectively.",
    "At current rates of expansion, LDCs would require nearly 41 years, LLDCs 38 years and small island developing States 11 years to match the 2022 levels in developing countries.",
    "Global primary energy intensity improved from 4.9 megajoules per dollar (2017 purchasing power parity) in 2015 to 4.6 in 2021.",
    "The energy intensity improvement rate for 2021 was only 0.8 per cent, however, influenced by a robust economic recovery after the pandemic and a shift towards energy-intensive industries.",
    "To meet the Goal 7 energy efficiency target by 2030, annual improvements must now average around 4 per cent.",
    "International public financial flows supporting clean energy in developing countries rebounded to $15.4 billion in 2022, an increase of 25 per cent over 2021 yet still around half the 2016 peak of $28.5 billion."
