An online public consultation \nwas held from April 4–11, 2025, with comments and \nsuggestions collected from more than 50 organizations \n– including several National Statistical Offices (NSOs) \n– and 40 UN member states. The full database and \nmethodological papers, as well as regional and local \neditions of the SDG Index and Dashboards, are avail-\nable on the SDG Transformation Center website.\nStatus of SDG progress globally\nBased on the rate of progress since they were adopted \nby the international community in 2015, none of the \n17 SDGs will be achieved by 2030 (Figure 2.1). At the \nglobal level, SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 11 (Sustainable \nCities and Communities), SDG 14 (Life Below Water), \nSDG 15 (Life on Land) and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and \nStrong Institutions) are particularly off track, facing \nmajor challenges (indicated in red on the dashboards) \nand showing no or very limited progress since 2015. \nThe SDG Index and Dashboards\nPart 2\nThe SDG Index and Dashboards provides an annual assessment of SDG progress covering all 193 UN \nmember states. This year’s SDG Index incorporates 126 indicators, including 102 global indicators and \n24 additional indicators for the OECD countries’ dashboards. To align with the 2025 comprehensive \nreview of SDG indicators, an indicator on “Minimum dietary diversity among children aged 6 months to \n23 months” has been incorporated into the dataset under SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). Other adjustments and \nmodifications are described in the methods section. Although every UN member state has a country \nprofile, only those with less than 20 percent missing data receive an SDG Index score and rank. This is to \nensure the comparability of the results and to minimize missing data bias. This year, 167 countries are \nranked in the SDG Index. This year’s edition also introduces a “headline” SDG Index (SDGi), which focuses \non 17 SDG indicators to evaluate progress made by countries and regions on the SDGs, while minimizing \nstatistical biases due to missing time series data. \nFigure 2.1  \nWorld SDG Dashboard 2025\nD\nD\nS\nD\nS\nD\n \n \n \n \n \nS\nD\nS\n•\nD\nD\n \n \n \n \n \nD\nD\nD\nD\nD\n \n \nSource: Authors\np   Decreasing                     5  Stagnating                                  D  Moderately improving        L   On track or maintaining SDG achievement       \n   Major challenges       \n  Significant challenges        \n  Challenges remain              \n   SDG achieved        • Data not available"

    "text": "14\nSustainable Development Report 2025   \n   Financing Sustainable Development to 2030 and Mid-Century\nPART 2 – THE SDG INDEX AND DASHBOARDS\nProgress on SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) is also \nvery limited, due in part to global failures to address \npersisting gaps in access to financing for developing \ncountries and to stark disparities in countries’ support \nfor UN-based multilateralism (see Part 3). Detailed dash-\nboards by world region, country grouping, and country \nare provided in the Annexes and country profiles. \nLess than 20 percent of the SDG targets are on \ntrack to be achieved globally (16.7 percent). The five \ntargets most on track are: Mobile use (SDG 9), Access \nto electricity (SDG 7), Internet use (SDG 9), Under 5 \nmortality rate (SDG 3) and Neonatal mortality (SDG 3). \nBy contrast, most countries are either stagnating or \nbacksliding on the following five targets: Obesity rate \n(SDG 2), Press Freedom Index (SDG 16), Sustainable \nNitrogen Management Index (SDG 2), Red List Index \n(SDG 15) and Corruption Perception Index (SDG 16).\nThe spread In SDG performance across countries \nremains wide, with 2025 SDG Index scores ranging \nfrom over 80 in top-performing countries to below 50 \nin countries where SDG implementation is especially \nchallenging, often due to various forms of conflict. As \nin previous editions, European countries, particularly \nthe Nordic countries, top the 2025 SDG Index. Finland \nranks first, followed by Sweden and Denmark. Finland \nalso holds the top spot on the World Happiness Report \nrankings (Helliwell et al. 2025). However, even these \ncountries face substantial challenges in achieving \nseveral SDGs, notably SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 12 \n(Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 \n(Climate Action) and SDG 15 (Life on Land), partly \ndriven by unsustainable consumption patterns and \nnegative international spillover effects. Countries at \nthe lower end of the Index tend to be affected by \nconflict, security issues, political or socioeconomic \ninstability, and limited fiscal space. In the 2025 \nedition, Yemen, Somalia, Chad, the Central African \nRepublic, and South Sudan rank at the bottom of the \nSDG Index.\nSDG progress by region and country \nThe “headline” SDG Index (SDGi) measures overall \ncountry progress using 17 key indicators, one per SDG. \nThis limited number of indicators aims to minimize \nstatistical biases related to missing time series data \nacross countries. Selection of these 17 indicators was \nbased on three main criteria: (1) relevance, with most \nbeing official SDG indicators or close proxies pro-\nduced by UN custodian agencies); (2) statistical criteria, \nnamely the ability of the individual SDGi indicators \nand of the headline aggregate to closely replicate \nthe goal and SDG Index results through correlation \nanalysis; and (3) data coverage across countries and \nover time. The cross-sectional correlation between \nthe SDGi (17 indicators) and the SDG Index (102 \nindicators) is very high (even collinear), while the SDGi \ngrowth rate between 2015–2024 is also correlated with \nthe growth rate of the full SDG Index over the same \nperiod. However, the SDGi growth rate is only moder-\nately correlated with the growth rate of GDP over the \nsame period. The 17 headline SDG indicators are listed \nbelow. Results were compiled for 143 countries, with \nthose missing data for more than two SDGi indicators \n(12 percent) excluded for comparability purposes. \nAmong those excluded, some face major challenges \nin implementing the SDGs or show major reversals \nin progress – including countries that are structurally \nvulnerable or affected by conflict. A detailed statistical \nannex is accessible online. \nCountries that started with higher SDG baselines in \n2015 have generally progressed more slowly than \nthose with lower baselines, although results vary \nacross regions and country groupings. The OECD \ncountries and HICs began with the highest SDG \nbaselines, primarily driven by better performance \non socioeconomic goals, however these countries \nhave generally shown limited progress on the SDGi \nsince 2015. By contrast, countries in East and South \nAsia, the BRICS+ nations, and LMICs, which all started \nwith lower baselines in 2015, have progressed more \nrapidly. Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and \nMiddle East and North Africa (MENA) countries, \ndespite initial baselines comparable to those of the \nBRICS and countries in East and South Asia, have pro-\ngressed much more slowly on the SDGs.

Accessible online here: https://sdgtransformationcenter.org/sdgindex \nBox 1.  A decade of SDG Index and Dashboards: global, regional, national, and subnational editions\nThe global edition of the SDG Index and Dashboards \nhighlights SDG trends and challenges across all countries. \nMore detailed regional, national, and subnational SDG Indices \nand analyses have also been prepared by the SDSN and its \nlocal networks. These editions contextualize the indicator \nsets and policy discussions to mobilize stakeholders at \nvarious levels. For instance, the Europe edition (released \nannually since 2019) is prepared in cooperation with the \nEuropean Economic and Social Committee (EESC) – including \nrepresentatives from trade unions, business associations and \nNGOs – and its findings are presented and discussed with \nEuropean leadership and institutions (Lafortune et al. 2024; \nLafortune and Fuller 2025). The SDSN has also worked with \nnumerous regional and local partners in the Arab region, \nin SIDS countries, and in countries including Benin, Bolivia, \nBrazil, Italy, Paraguay, Spain, the United States, and Uruguay \nto advance SDG monitoring and connect statistical analyses \nwith long-term budgeting and policy frameworks. The \nresulting editions benefit from local expertise, often provided \nby SDSN networks hosted in universities and research \ncenters, and from large-scale consultations and discussions \nboth before and after assessments are performed. \nIncreasingly, they also leverage GIS-technologies to provide \nmore granular analyses. These have been referenced multiple \ntimes in Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs). In Europe, the \nEuropean Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) listed the \nSDG Index and Dashboards as one of the most useful for \npolicymaking (EPRS 2021)."

SDG Index & Dashboards\nSDG progress by region and country \ncountries in Sub-Saharan Africa and low-income coun-\ntries (LICs) started off with the lowest 2015 baselines, \nother regions with higher baselines have progressed \nfaster. Factors such as various forms of conflicts, \nstructural vulnerabilities, weak institutional leadership, \nand limited fiscal space may explain disparities in SDG \nprogress since 2015. \nAt the same time, the regional and income-group \naggregates hide significant disparities in SDG progress \nacross countries. Globally, Benin, Togo, Côte d’Ivoire, \nEswatini, and Uzbekistan have progressed the fastest \non the SDGi since 2015. By contrast, Afghanistan, \nAlgeria, the Syrian Arab Republic, Venezuela, and \nYemen have stagnated or experienced reversals in \nprogress (Figure 2.4.a). Compared with their regional \npeers, Benin, Nepal, Peru, the United Arab Emirates, \nand Uzbekistan have showed the fastest progres-\nsion (Figure 2.4.b.). Costa Rica has progressed the \nfastest among OECD countries, whereas Saudi Arabia \nhas progressed the fastest of the G20 countries \n(Figure 2.4.c). \nBox 2. The SDG Index and Geographic Information Systems \nGeographic Information Systems (GIS) \nand Earth Observation (EO) technolo-\ngies are crucial for SDG monitoring and \nspatial analysis (United Nations, 2021). \nA recent paper published by the Inter-\nAgency and Expert Group on Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal Indicators (IAEG-\nSDGs), with contributions from the SDSN’s \nSDG Transformation Center, contains an \nupdated shortlist of SDG indicators that \ndirectly or indirectly require geospatial \ndata or tools — approximately 20 percent \nof all SDG indicators (United Nations \n2025). The need to disaggregate SDG \nindicator data by geographic location is \nalso recognized by the United Nations, as \nthis speaks to the “leave no one behind” \nprinciple of the 2030 Agenda, while data \ninsights at a sub-national level help policy-\nmakers tailor their interventions to specific \ncontexts. Preliminary research using \nhigh-resolution satellite imagery estimates \nthat around 40 percent of the world’s \npopulation might be assigned to a diffe-\nrent SDG Index quintile than that of their \naggregated national SDG Index estimate, \nwhich suggests significant and persistent \nterritorial disparities in SDG performance \nwithin countries (Iablonovski 2024).\nAt the SDSN, the SDG Transformation \nCenter and SDGs Today programs leverage \nGIS technologies to provide granular and \ntimely assessments of SDG challenges and \nprogress. Over the past three editions, \nof the global SDR, as well as through \nbilateral collaborative initiatives, the SDG \nTransformation Center has introduced \nnew, innovative geospatial indicators for \nthe SDGs, building notably on a long-\nterm partnership with the Environmental \nSystems Research Institute (ESRI) and \nother partners. These geospatial indicators \naddress critical data gaps and provide \nannual insights into the state of a set of \nSDG indicators at both national and local \nlevels, utilizing open global datasets and \ncloud computing methods. \n•\t SDG indicator 9.1.1, the Rural Access \nIndex (RAI) considers the proportion \nof the rural population living within \ntwo kilometers of an all-season road. \nThe SDR presents, to date, the only \npublicly available application of the \nWorld Bank’s latest methodology at a \nglobal scale (Iablonovski et al. 2024; \nWorkman and McPherson 2019). The \nparticular challenge of this indicator’s \ncalculation lies in assessing whether \na road provides all-season access, \napproximated through data on precip-\nitation, slope, and spatialized GDP per \ncapita. The method used in the SDR \nwas leveraged by the World Bank (the \ncustodian agency for this indicator) for \nits Score Card platform (World Bank \nGroup 2025). \n•\t SDG indicator 11.2.1, Urban Access \nto Public Transportation measures \npedestrian accessibility, or the extent to \nwhich the built environment facilitates \nwalking access to destinations of \ninterest. Through network analysis, \ndata on pedestrian infrastructure, \ngeographically allocated places of \ninterest, and population distribution \nare used to calculate the time a \nperson would take to walk to the \nclosest amenity. The expanded \nmethodology covers additional key \nservices (healthcare services, education \nfacilities, food choices, and open public \nspaces) to fully assess urban pedestrian \naccessibility.\nThese and other indicators, such as SDG \n11.3.1 (Land Use Efficiency) and yearly CO2 \nemissions from anthropogenic land-use \nchange, by main driver (2014–2023), are \npublished on the SDG Transformation \nCenter website and available to download. \nLeveraging GIS and EO technologies to \ninform long-term investment and poli cy \npathways for the SDGs at all levels will \nremain a key focus of research at the \nSDSN and SDG Transformation Center in \nthe coming years. \nSource: Authors, based on https://\nsdgtransformationcenter.org/geospatial"

As such, their \ndomestic implementation should not compromise the \nability of other countries to achieve them (Schmidt-\nTraub, Hoff, and Bernlöhr 2019; Lafortune et al. \n2021; Gómez-Paredes, Malik, and Lafortune 2025). \nVia unsustainable consumption, the export of toxic \nwaste, illicit trade, unfair tax competition, tax havens \nand, more generally, poor implementation of SDG 17 \n(Partnerships for the Goals – including support for \nUN-based multilateralism), countries can, however, gen-\nerate negative international spillovers. These spillovers \nare incorporated in the SDG Index and also compiled \nseparately as part of the “International Spillover Index”. \nPositive spillovers (or “handprints”) are also consid-\nered, such as the provision of Official Development \nAssistance (ODA).
