Addressing pressing environmental \nchallenges and their underlying drivers and interconnections – \nincluding climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, desertification \nand deforestation – demands intensified, accelerated efforts, and a \ncomprehensive and integrated approach at local, national and global \nlevels. \nLife on land\nReducing deforestation depends on improving food security, income and land rights\nBetween 2000 and 2020, the proportion of forest cover decreased from \n31.9 to 31.2 per cent of total land area, resulting in net forest area losses of \nnearly 100 million hectares. Agricultural expansion drove almost 90 per cent \nof global deforestation; cropland accounted for 49.6 per cent and livestock \ngrazing for 38.5 per cent. Globally, small-scale farming caused 68 per cent \nof agriculture-driven deforestation, while large-scale farming contributed to \n32 per cent. In Africa, small-scale farming was responsible for 97 per cent \nof agriculture-driven deforestation. Forest losses due to large-scale farming \nwere highest in South America at 48 per cent (mainly linked to livestock \ngrazing), followed by Asia at 38 per cent (primarily due to large-scale crop \nproduction, particularly for oil palm plantations).\nThese findings suggest that efforts to reduce deforestation must tackle \nproduction system weaknesses while addressing critical needs such as food \nsecurity, income and land tenure rights for local communities. Stemming \ndeforestation also demands a comprehensive approach blending regulatory \nmeasures, market incentives and stakeholder collaboration to promote \nsustainable land management and preserve forest ecosystems.\nA national park manager surveys tree nursery saplings in a desert \narea of central Saudi Arabia that is being regreened to combat land \ndegradation, desertification and drought.\nLivestock grazing\nOther drivers\nCropland expansion\nUrban and infrastructure development\nDam construction and change in water courses\nCropland expansion, 49.6\nOil palm, 7.0\nLivestock grazing, 38.5\nOther \ndrivers, 4.0\nDam construction \nand change in water \ncourses, 1.8\nUrban and infra-\nstructure develop-\nment, 6.2\nAgriculture, 88.1\nNote: “Other drivers” refers to severe degradation affecting natural regeneration \nwhereby forests are transformed into bare soil or other wooded land.

Over 44,000 \nspecies, or 28 per cent of almost 160,000 assessed species, are currently \nthreatened. They include 70 per cent of cycads and 41 per cent of \namphibians. The latter are particularly impacted by climate change, habitat \nconversion and invasive fungal disease. For example, Buckley’s glass frog, \nassessed as Critically Endangered and found only in the Ecuadorian Andes, \nfaces increased extinction risk due to habitat loss from expanding agriculture \nand livestock grazing, fungal disease and climate change. Regionally, severe \nbiodiversity declines across all species groups are evident in Central and \nSouthern Asia as well as in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia. Stopping \nthe ongoing decline in biodiversity is an urgent race against time, making \naccelerated conservation efforts imperative to safeguard the irreplaceable \nand intricate web of life on the planet.\nGoal 15 | Life on land\n* Excluding Australia and New Zealand.\nNote: A Red List Index value of 1.0 means that all species are categorized as of “Least Concern”; \nhence, none are expected to become extinct in the near future.

Illegal trade has affected around 4,000 plant and animal species in \n162 countries and territories from 2015 to 2021. This exploitation jeopardizes \nthe survival of species and undermines ecosystem functions, especially when \ncompounded by other pressures, such as habitat loss and climate change. \nRecent estimates indicate that the intercepted illegal wildlife trade as \na proportion of all wildlife trade (legal and illegal) has been on the rise \nsince 2017, peaking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wildlife seizures \ncomprised over 1.9 and 1.4 per cent of global wildlife trade in 2020 and \n2021, respectively. Trends likely reflect a disproportionate reduction in legal \ntrade during the pandemic and an increase in enforcement efforts for certain \nwildlife commodities. For instance, more wildlife seizures were primarily \nattributed to new regulations targeting high-value timber species from South \nAmerica, alongside intensified enforcement actions. \nTrend in the proportion of wildlife trade represented by wildlife seizures, 2016–2021 \n(percentage)\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nPlants\nAnimals\nTotal\nDetrimental land cover changes are impacting mountain ecosystems\nBetween 2015 and 2019, at least 100 million hectares of productive land \nwere degraded annually, adversely impacting global food and water security. \nThis degradation, driven by changes in land use and coverage, significantly \ncontributes to biodiversity loss, including in fragile mountain ecosystems. \nThe widespread transformation of mountain ecosystems is due to various \nnatural and human-induced factors, such as climate change, natural \nhazards, unplanned agriculture and urbanization, timber extraction and \nrecreation. Globally, only about a third of mountain key biodiversity areas are \nsafeguarded by protected areas or other effective area-based conservation \nmeasures.\nGlobal data from 2000 to 2018 indicate that degradation affects about \n1.6 per cent of the world’s mountainous areas. The highest proportion of \ndegraded mountain land is in the alpine areas of Europe and Northern \nAmerica (2.29 per cent), followed by the montane areas of Central and \nSouthern Asia (2.22 per cent) and the lower mountain belts of Eastern \nand South-Eastern Asia (2.17 per cent). Mountain ecosystem degradation \nthreatens downstream water provision, through  reduced glacial coverage, \nas well as biodiversity and other ecosystem services, thereby undermining \nefforts to protect terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Furthermore, \ndiminished forest and vegetation coverage increase soil erosion, heightening \nthe risk of downstream landslides and flooding.\nProportion of degraded mountain land by bioclimatic belt, 2015 and 2018 \n(percentage)\nNote: Mountains can be subdivided vertically into seven bioclimatic belts based on average \ntemperatures, which helps account for latitudinal changes in the elevation of thermally similar \nareas in the world’s mountains. This facilitates global comparisons. Indicator 15.4.2 aggregates \nseven bioclimatic belts into four (nival, alpine, montane and remaining mountain areas). \nThe treeline is between the alpine and montane belts.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n2015\n2018\n2015\n2018\n2015\n2018\n2015\n2018\n2015\n2018\n2015\n2018\n2015\n2018\n2015\n2018\n2015\n2018\nOceania*\nSub-Saharan\nAfrica\nNorthern Africa\nand Western\nAsia\nLatin America\nand the\nCaribbean\nCentral and\nSouthern Asia\nEastern and\nSouth-Eastern\nAsia\nEurope and\nNorthern\nAmerica\nAustralia and\nNew Zealand\nWorld\nRemaining mountain area\nMontane\nAlpine\nNival\n* Excluding Australia and New Zealand."
