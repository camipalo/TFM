From 2015 to 2019, the world \nmade some progress on the SDGs, although this was already vastly insufficient to achieve the goals. Since the \noutbreak of the pandemic in 2020 and other simultaneous crises, SDG progress has stalled globally. In most high-\nincome countries (HICs), automatic stabilizers, emergency expenditure, and recovery plans mitigated the impacts \nof these multiple crises on socioeconomic outcomes. Only limited progress is being made on the environmental \nand biodiversity goals, including SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action), \nSDG 14 (Life Below Water), and SDG 15 (Life on Land), even in countries that are largely to blame for the climate and \nbiodiversity crises. The disruptions caused by these multiple crises has aggravated fiscal-space issues in low-income \ncountries (LICs) and in lower-middle income countries (LMICs), leading to a reversal in progress on several goals and \nindicators. Despite this alarming development, the SDGs are still achievable. None of their objectives are beyond our \nreach. The world is off track, but that is all the more reason to double down on the SDGs.\nAt their core, the SDGs are an investment agenda: it is critical that UN Member States adopt and implement \nthe SDG Stimulus and support a comprehensive reform of the global financial architecture. To achieve the \nSDGs the world must both alter its current investment patterns and increase the overall volume of investments. \nThe Stimulus’ urgent objective is to address the chronic shortfall of international SDG financing confronting the \nLICs and LMICs, and to ramp up financing flows by at least US$500 billion by 2025. This year’s report also highlights \nsix priorities to reform the complex system of public and private finance that channels the world’s savings to its \ninvestments – what is known as the Global Financial Architecture: \n1.\t Greatly increase funding to national and subnational governments and private businesses, especially in LICs \nand LMICs, to carry out needed SDG investments. \n2.\t Revise the credit rating system and debt sustainability metrics to facilitate long-term sustainable development. \n3.\t Revise liquidity structures for LICs and LMICs, especially regarding sovereign debts, to forestall self-fulfilling \nbanking and balance-of-payments crises; \n4.\t Create ambitious, internationally-agreed upon criteria for sustainable finance that are mandatory for all public \nfinancial institutions. \n5.\t Align private business investment flows with the SDGs, through improved national planning, regulation, \nreporting, and oversight. \n6.\t Reform current institutional frameworks and develop new mechanisms to improve the quality and speed of \ndeployment of international cooperation, and monitor progress in an open and timely manner.\nAll countries, poorer and richer alike, should use the half-way momentum to self-critically review and revise \ntheir national SDG strategies and commit to strengthening multilateralism. National governments must \nensure both domestic implementation of the SDGs, including the reduction of negative spillovers, and international \nimplementation – by building a global governance and financial architecture that delivers the SDGs. Building \non SDSN’s global survey of government efforts and commitment to the SDGs and third-party data, we highlight \nmajor differences across countries, including G20 countries, in their SDG strategies and commitment. Achieving \nthe SDGs requires global cooperation guided by the United Nations Charter. In 2022, the United Nations Secretary-\nGeneral appointed a High-Level Advisory Board (HLAB) on effective multilateralism, with a mandate to develop a \nlist of concrete, actionable recommendations to improve international cooperation and advance the 2030 Agenda \nfor Sustainable Development. We introduce in the report this year a pilot index of countries commitment to and \nsupport of multilateralism under the UN Charter. SDG transformations.",

At the halfway mark to 2030, there remains a great deal of work to be done to improve the \ndata and methods underlying the SDG indicator framework. Evidence suggests that since 2016 there has been only \nlimited progress and convergence in countries’ statistical capacity, including LICs and LMICs, and that international \nfunding for data and statistics fell between 2019 and 2021. Also, in an information-rich and post-truth environment, \ncitizens and decision-makers need knowledge and tools to transform data and science into evidence, actions, and \nlong-term policies. According to major international studies, few teenagers can differentiate between a fact and an \nopinion. As underlined during the United Nations World Data Forum 2023 and in the 27 April Hangzhou Declaration, \ninvesting in statistical capacity, science, and data literacy are important priorities for achieving the SDGs. \nThe SDSN and its global network will double-down on efforts to implement the SDGs by 2030 and beyond. \nThe SDSN was created in 2012, soon after the Rio+20 Summit, to mobilize the world’s universities, think tanks, \nand national laboratories on behalf of the SDGs. SDSN’s mission was fourfold: (i) scholarly research, (ii) educational \ninnovation and partnerships, (iii) convening power, and (iv) outreach to the public. We are proud of our efforts \nsince 2012 in these four areas. The SDSN is now a global network of more than 1,900 member organizations, mainly \nuniversities, organized in 53 national and regional chapters. Via science-based pathways and analytics, the SDSN \nsupports discussions on SDG implementation at the global, regional, and national levels. These are available on the \nnewly set up, open-access, SDG Transformation Center Portal. All UN Member States and UN agencies can count on \nthe continued efforts and energies of the SDSN around the world to support all governments, businesses, and civil \nsociety in embracing and aligning with the SDGs on sustainable development.",

At the global level, averaging \nacross countries, not a single SDG is currently projected to \nbe met by 2030, with the poorest countries struggling the \nmost. And global cooperation has ebbed as geopolitical \ntensions have risen. In response to this situation, United \nNations Secretary-General António Guterres has urged \nworld leaders to come together at the 2023 SDG Summit \nin September to deliver a “Rescue Plan for People and \nPlanet”.1 SDSN offers the following recommendations \nto accelerate progress over the remaining seven years \nto 2030, and to set even more ambitious targets to be \nachieved by 2050 under the SDG framework.\nAs the world’s nations prepare to meet in September to \nreview the progress the world has made so far towards \nachieving the SDGs, at the midpoint of the 2030 Agenda, \nSDSN emphasizes six areas for immediate action. \nI.\t Most urgently, UN Member States should adopt an \nSDG Stimulus, to close the massive financing gap \nfaced by many developing economies. As called for by \nUnited Nations Secretary-General António Guterres,2 \nthe SDG Stimulus plan has five main components:\n1.\t Increased funding from the multilateral develop-\nment banks (MDBs) and public development banks \n(PDBs) to low- and middle-income countries, linked \nto investments in the SDGs;\n2.\t Enhancement of relief for countries facing debt \ndistress;\n3.\t Expansion of liquidity by the International Monetary \nFund (IMF) and major central banks;\n4.\t Empowerment and expansion of the specialized global \nfunds; and\n5.\t Expansion of private philanthropy with a focus on ultra-\nhigh-net-worth individuals.\nII.\t UN Member States must endorse a deep and overdue \nreform of the global financial architecture. SDSN \nidentifies six priorities for this reform:\n1.\t Greatly increased funding for national and \nsubnational governments and private businesses in \nthe emerging economies, especially the low-income \ncountries (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries \n(LMICs), to carry out needed SDG actions;\n2.\t Revision of the credit-rating system and debt-\nsustainability metrics to facilitate long-term \nsustainable development;\n3.\t Revision of the liquidity structures for LICs and \nLMICs, especially regarding sovereign debt, to \nforestall self-fulfilling banking and balance-of-\npayments crises;\n4.\t Creation of ambitious, internationally-agreed \ncriteria for sustainable finance that are mandatory \nfor all public financial institutions in high-income \ncountries (HICs), middle-income countries (MICs), \nand LICs alike.\n5.\t Alignment of private business investment flows \nin all countries with the SDGs, through improved \nnational planning, regulation, reporting, and \noversight. \n6.\t A reform of current institutional frameworks and \ndevelopment of new and innovative mechanisms \nto improve the quality and speed of deployment of \ninternational cooperation, and the monitoring of \nprogress in an open and timely manner.\nPart 1.

    "text": "4   \nIntroduction\nThe SDGs are facing strong headwinds. Despite significant \nefforts in some places, national governments on all \ncontinents have fallen short in integrating the SDGs \ninto national policies and public investments. Moreover, \nsocietal polarization, populism, and growing geopolitical \nconflict are hindering the global cooperation needed \nto achieve the SDGs. Civil society, including academic \ninstitutions, is becoming more constrained in the midst of \nintensifying political tensions. The international financial \narchitecture is failing to channel global savings to SDG \ninvestments at the needed pace and scale. \nWe emphasize that achieving the SDGs rests on five pillars \nof good governance:\n1.\t Preparing long-term SDG pathways to guide public \npolicy; \n2.\t Ensuring SDG financing at the necessary scale and \ntiming; \n3.\t Promoting global cooperation and reducing \ngeopolitical conflict and tension; \n4.\t Supporting innovation to broaden social inclusion and \nenvironmental sustainability;\n5.\t Regular reporting on SDG progress and performance.\nThe SDGs are not only a public policy framework; they are \nan ethical imperative. They are grounded in the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, which celebrates its 75th \nanniversary this year. The SDGs are based on its core \npremises; that “All human beings are born free and equal in \ndignity and rights … and should act towards one another \nin a spirit of brotherhood,” and that “it is essential to promote \nthe development of friendly relations between nations.” \nAs the Universal Declaration makes clear, and the SDGs \nmake explicit, social justice and sustainable development \nrequire the full realization of the rights of all people. This \nincludes equality of opportunities for girls and women \n(SDG 5), respect for the rights and voice of Indigenous \npeoples around the world, and a much larger role for \nyoung people, who will face the consequences of our (in)\nactions throughout the 21st century. \nThe UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network \n(SDSN) is dedicated to finding and amplifying practical \nsolutions to achieve the SDGs and closely-related \nglobal goals (such as the Paris climate agreement and \nthe Kunming-Montreal Biodiversity Framework). We \nemphasize that all these global goals are interrelated \nand must be achieved together. Members of the SDSN \nLeadership Council offer the following assessments and \nrecommendations to the UN Member States, the United \nNations Agencies, international finance institutions, \nbusiness, and civil society, based on more than a decade \nof research, measurement, advising, and partnerships \nacross the world. \n4.\t Hansen, James et al. 2002.

SDG progress \nwas already very slow in the five years to 2020. According \nto the annual SDG Index, global achievement of the SDGs \nrose only slightly, from 64 percent in 2015 to 66 percent \nin 2019 – far too slowly to meet the goals by 2030, \nand with highly uneven progress within and between \ncountries. Then with the onset of the pandemic, progress \nstopped. As of 2022, the global SDG Index is below 67%. \nAt current trends, based on simple projections, there is a \nrisk that the gap in SDG outcomes between HICs and LICs \nwill be wider in 2030 (29 points) than it was in 2015 (28 \npoints). This means that we are at risk of losing a decade \nof progress towards convergence globally (Figure 1.2). \nThe multiple geopolitical crises in the world today will no \ndoubt place further obstacles on the path to 2030. If we \nlook at each of the 17 individual SDGs, not a single SDG is \nprojected to be met at the global level.\nThe world is also seriously off track to meet the Paris \nagreement climate targets and SDG 13 (Figure 1.3). \nGlobal warming as of 2022 stood at 1.2°C, with warming \ncontinuing at more than 0.3°C per decade.4 At this rate, \nthe likelihood of overshooting 1.5°C, even within a \ndecade, is very strong.

Even taking the net-zero pledges of many \ncountries into account, best-case scenarios given current \npledges would lead to around 1.8°C warming by 2100. \nBiodiversity targets (SDG 15 and targets agreed under the \nCBD) are also at grave risk. All dimensions of biodiversity, \nincluding species abundance, species diversity, and \nthe functioning of ecosystems, are under threat. It has \nbeen announced that the current loss of species rate \nis 1,000–10,000 times more than the natural extinction \nrate.

We must therefore acknowledge the real risk of \nnegative “social tipping points” beyond which peaceful \ngovernance and co-existence breaks down, as it did in \nWorld War I and World War II. \nWe firmly believe that international cooperation together \nwith the achievement of the SDGs is the best preventative \nto this dire and growing risk, and represent an opportunity \nto create positive social tipping points: for example, \nthrough equal access to high-quality education (SDG 4), \nand by fighting all forms of inequalities, including income \nand wealth inequalities (SDG 10). \nWe see across societies that inequalities are rising. \nEnvironmental crises weigh most heavily on the poorest \nand most marginalized individuals. At the same time, \ntechnological advances such as artificial intelligence and \nrobotics have the potential to eliminate many working-\nclass and professional jobs. The COVID-19 pandemic also \nseverely depleted trust in governments. Many societies, \nand not only the poorest ones, are facing increased crises \nof governance, marked by political and social instability, \ngeneral strikes, and a further loss of public confidence in \ngovernment. Although all governments are in principle \ncommitted to economic justice as enshrined in the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, and to the SDG \ntenets of ‘leave no one behind’ and ‘reach the furthest \nbehind first’, too few are living up to these commitments, \nespecially as powerful groups block adequate public \nsupport for weaker groups. \nIn her 2022 report on the SDGs, E.

There are calls in many \ncountries to increase military budgets, even as the SDGs \nare woefully underfunded at home and internationally. \nNew records on global military spending were reached in \n2022, totaling US$2.2 trillion, even as the most basic social \nservices were under grave stress in many countries. \nEconomic tipping points could accompany or be \ntriggered by environmental, social, governance, and \ngeopolitical tipping points. Banking failures are a prime \nexample of an economic tipping point: the national \neconomy deteriorates to the point where a financial crisis \nis triggered, in turn pushing the economy into a massive \ndownturn. This was seen in the Great Depression of the \n1930s and the Great Recession of 2008. Similarly, extreme \npoverty can lead to a collapse of tax revenues, followed by \ngovernment bankruptcy and further economic collapse, a \nsyndrome that now threatens dozens of poor countries. \n12.\tSachs JD, Schmidt-Traub G, Lafortune G., 2020. Speaking truth to \npower about the SDGs, Nature. https://www.nature.com/articles/\nd41586-020-02373-7\nInvesting in the SDGs \nDespite this ominous news, the SDGs are still achievable. \nNone of their objectives are beyond our reach.12 Yes, \nthe world is off-track, but that is all the more reason to \ndouble-down on the goals, rather than surrendering to \nhuman-made shortfalls in achieving them. Our future \nremains in our hands. \nAt their core, the SDGs are an investment agenda. In the \nmost basic terms, the world must devote an increased \nportion of current output to building up sustainable \ncapital assets for the future, and must deploy such assets \neffectively. Sustainable capital assets are long-lasting \ncapital resources that can enable the world to meet the \nagreed goals of economic well-being, social justice, and \nenvironmental sustainability. The world must both shift \nits current investment patterns and increase the overall \ninvestment flow in order to build the future we want.\nDevelopment practitioners have identified eight major \nkinds of capital assets:\n1.\t Human capital: The skills and health of a productive \ncitizenry, supported by universal health access \nand coverage, quality education, shared data and \nknowledge, promotion of a culture of peace and non-\nviolence, global citizenship, and the appreciation of \ncultural diversity.\n2.\t Infrastructure: Energy production and distribution, \nland and sea transport, telecommunications, digital \ninformation services, public buildings (e.g., schools and \nhospitals), and safe water and sanitation. \n3.\t Natural capital: The capacity and healthy functioning \nof ecosystems, to be protected by ending human-\ninduced climate change, protecting biodiversity, \nsustainably managing freshwater resources, and \neliminating toxic pollutants. \n4.\t Innovation capital: The stock of intellectual property \nand data resulting from public and private research and \ndevelopment, creative cultural works, and responsibly \ngoverned and managed emerging technologies.\n5.\t Business capital: Goods and services of true social \nvalue derived from utilizing the machinery, buildings, \ninformation resources, and other capital assets that \nunderpin business productivity.\n6.\t Social capital: Social trust and pro-social values, good \ngovernance and justice, freedom of speech and the \npress, trusted scientific capabilities, and international \ncooperation. \n7.\t Urban capital: Spatial human settlements, notably \nin urban areas, that drive and support productive and \ncreative interactions across the other seven capital \nassets.\n8.\t Cultural capital: Appreciation of the diversity of \ncultures, value systems, languages, the traditional \nknowledge systems of Indigenous peoples, and artistic \nexpressions.\nThese capital assets are complementary; that is, they \nwork together in a mutually-supportive manner.

Challenges \nsuch as decarbonization cannot be met with existing \ntechnologies alone, and so depend on continued \ninnovation and scientific research, especially in countries \nwhere investment is low. There is no hope of achieving \nglobal food security for more than eight billion people \nunless Earth’s natural capital is protected. And there is \nno hope for global peace unless there is respect for, and \ninvestment in, cultural capital and cultural diversity. \nTo achieve the SDGs, the world must invest boldly, \namply, and consistently in all eight kinds of capital. \nThese investments must involve both governments \nand corporations. For example, while business capital is \nmainly the purview of the private sector, human capital \nis mainly the purview of the public sector. Governments \ntoo must take the lead in protecting natural capital, \nwhile civil society especially must promote social and \ncultural capital, including mutual understanding across \ncultures and nations. Infrastructure capital and innovation \ncapital tend to be financed roughly equally by the public \nand private sectors. For example, governments tend \nto finance power transmission grids, while the private \nsector tends to finance power generation. Governments \ngenerally finance basic scientific research, while \nbusinesses focus on applied R&D. \nParallel to investing in the SDGs, the world needs to \nstop investing in activities that threaten planetary \nboundaries, destroy human and natural capital, and harm \nsocial cohesion. Curtailing the extraction and use of \nfossil fuels is of paramount importance. To curb harmful \ninvestments, regulatory measures, including fair and \nsustainable taxation and the dismantling of unsustainable \nsubsidies, need to be an integral element of the SDG \ninvestment agenda.\nIn 2022, the United Nations Secretary-General appointed \na High-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism, \nwith a mandate to develop a list of concrete, actionable \nrecommendations to improve international cooperation \nand advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment. The Board’s 2023 report lists six areas for \naction that are directly aligned with the SDGs and SDSN’s \nrecommendations: rebuilding trust in multilateralism, \nsafeguarding our planet and its people, scaling up and \nimproving the efficacy of global finance, improving data \nsystems and their governance, and promoting peace.13\n13.\tHigh-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism (HLAB), \n2022.

They are members of the United \nNations and the signatories of United Nations treaties. \nThey hold juridical responsibility for implementing \ntreaty agreements and the rest of the United Nations \narchitecture, including the United Nations Charter, the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, and the SDGs. \nNational governments must ensure both the domestic \nimplementation of the SDGs, including the reduction of \nnegative spillovers, and international implementation by \nbuilding a global governance and financial architecture \nthat delivers the SDGs. Crucially, national government \nmust also work with subnational governments to \nimplement the SDG agenda at the local level, including \nsustainable urban infrastructure, delivery of social services, \nand ensuring safe communities.\nVirtually all governments of the world have embraced \nthe SDGs in principle. 188 of 193 UN Member States have \nsubmitted VNRs for comment by the other nations. Only \nfive countries, notably the United States, Haiti, Myanmar, \nSouth Sudan, and Yemen, have never presented VNRs. \nFour of these countries are wracked by violence and \npoverty.

These are some of the \nfindings of SDSN’s annual (2023) survey on government \nefforts and commitments for the SDGs, which is \nconducted in close cooperation with our global network \nof experts and practitioners. Of 74 governments analyzed, \nwe see large differences in terms of government efforts \nand commitments (see Part 3).\nThe greatest responsibility for achieving the SDGs and \nsafeguarding the planetary boundaries lies with the G20 \nmembers. These countries represent more than 80% of \nglobal GDP, around 70% of the world’s forests, more than \n60% of the earth’s population, and more than 50% of its \nlandmass. The G20 countries account for 90% of global \nlignite and coal extraction and more than 60% of global \noil and gas production. \nThe United States, as the world’s biggest economy in \nterms of GDP at market prices and its biggest oil and \ngas producer, has a responsibility both to itself and \nto the rest of the world to immediately embark on an \nambitious transformation towards the SDGs, as well as \ntowards other global climate and biodiversity goals.

The EGD embraces \nan EU-wide set of goals, timelines to 2050, and financing \nstrategies across major dimensions of the SDGs: energy \ndecarbonization, climate resilience, circular economy (to \ncut pollution), sustainable agriculture (the “farm-to-fork” \nstrategy), digital access, and innovation. EU-wide financial \nresources, notably the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility, \nwere mobilized to support the EGD. The European \nRegional Development Fund, which provides the EU \ncohesion funds, is also directed towards the EGD. The \nHorizon Europe program and EU Missions in Horizon \nEurope catalyze the EU’s efforts to stimulate innovation \nand identify concrete solutions for the EGD. However, \nthe EGD and EU policies at large lack a comprehensive \nalignment to the SDGs, politically agreed targets for many \nSDG indicators, and clarity on how to achieve the SDGs. \nThe EU has also highlighted the strategic role of the \nprivate sector in achieving the SDGs, by implementing a \nnew directive asking companies to publish sustainability \nreports and, in particular in the food sector, by promoting \nthe “Code of Conduct on Responsible Food Business and \nMarketing Practices”, a tool for setting out the actions that \nagri-food companies can voluntarily commit to in order \nto tangibly improve and communicate their sustainability \nperformance. SDSN’s Europe SDR emphasizes the \nimportance of living up to the ambitions of the EGD \nand the SDGs, both inside the EU as well as in the EU’s \nforeign actions, despite the multiple crises faced.15 In \nJuly 2023, the EU is set to present its first Union-wide \nvoluntary review at the United Nations. This presents a \ngood opportunity for the EU to send a strong message \nto the international community, and to demonstrate its \ncommitment to and leadership on the SDGs.\nChina, as the world’s largest economy in purchasing-\npower-adjusted terms and its biggest coal producer, \nintends to implement the SDGs by integrating them \ninto its medium and long-term national development \nstrategies, such as its five-year plans.

Yet current methods and mechanisms for \nimplementing the Agenda largely reflect pre-2015 world \nrealities and are far from meeting the universality and \ntransformative ambition of the SDGs. Four basic failures \nstand out: First, implementation is largely left to the \nnational level and on a voluntary basis, without effective \nmultilateral enforcement mechanisms in place. Second, \ndeveloped countries are not being held to account, \nneither for their adverse spillovers, nor for ensuring \nadequate flows of financing for sustainable development. \nThird, the rules governing trade and international \nfinance are not geared towards the SDGs. For example, \nglobalized trade rules for ‘cleantech’ could accelerate \nthe energy transition and offer protections to workers, \nhowever such rules have not been negotiated or agreed \nupon. Unifying international business ecosystems could \nsimilarly improve industrial supply chains, particularly \nby leveraging artificial intelligence. And fourth, national \ngovernments typically lack ‘vertical’ coordination with \nsubnational governments for SDG implementation. \nBoth the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Climate Agreement \nestablished mechanisms to encourage and monitor \ntheir implementation by nation-states. However, \nexperience so far with VNRs and Nationally Determined \nContributions (NDCs), respectively, demonstrate that \nthese mechanisms – despite some progress – have not \ndelivered the effort necessary to achieve global goals. \nEven the progress on consistent national reporting on \nSDG indicators is inadequate. There are no assessments \nor recommendations by the respective secretariats or \ndecision-making bodies on the adequacy or further \nenhancement of national implementation, let alone \nmeasures of enforcement. This is especially important \nfor those SDGs where national (non-)compliance has \nsignificant externalities for the global community and \navoiding threats to the planetary boundaries.

The \nGFA includes multilateral institutions (for example, IMF and \nWorld Bank), national and local budgets, public borrowing \nand debts, and private equity and debt financing. Financial \ninstitutions that intermediate savings and investment play \na key role, including national and multilateral development \nbanks (publicly owned banks that borrow from capital \nmarkets to on-lend funds to public and private entities), \nsovereign wealth funds, private-sector banks, insurance \nfunds, pension funds, asset management funds, venture \ncapital, credit rating agencies, and others. \nThe global financial architecture falls short in the following \nsix ways:\n1.\t Deep, chronic, and crippling under-investment in \nvirtually all low-income countries (LICs) and lower-\nmiddle-income countries (LMICs). In 2022, Investment \nper person in the LICs averaged a meagre US$175 per \nperson, compared with US$11,535 per person in the \nHICs. (Table 1.1). In fact, investment as a share of GDP \nwas lower in the LICs (20.9%) than in all other income \ncategories. The poor are consequently languishing in \npoverty. \n2.\t Most LICs and LMICs (and many small-island \ndeveloping states [SIDS], including those that are \nUMICs) lack the credit ratings to borrow on acceptable \nterms (Table 1.2)\n3.\t LICs, LMICs, and SIDS are highly vulnerable to self-\nfulfilling liquidity crises and balance of payments \ncrises, making it nearly impossible for these countries \nto implement a long-term sustainable investment \nstrategy. \n4.\t HICs are able to mobilize vast financial resources \nvery quickly, as seen during the 2008 financial crisis, \nthe pandemic, and the war in Ukraine. Yet they are \nnot prepared to mobilize such resources for global \nsustainable development, despite the urgency and \nprevious promises regarding development assistance \nand climate financing. \n5.\t Private capital markets continue to direct large flows \nof private saving to unsustainable technologies and \npractices, delaying decarbonization of the world’s \nenergy system and underpinning destruction of the \nworld’s ecosystems. \n6.\t International cooperation is trapped by bureaucratic \ninstitutional frameworks that reduce the speed, \nefficacy, and efficiency of funding to meet the SDGs, \nand that fail to provide the framework for large-scale \nSDG financing. \nIt is widely recognized that the world needs to overhaul \nthe GFA. Such an overhaul should address the failures \nabove and aim to achieve six objectives:\n1.\t Greatly increase funding to national and subnational \ngovernments and private businesses in the emerging \neconomies, especially the LICs and LMICs, to carry out \nthe needed investments.\n2.\t Revise the credit rating system and debt sustainability \nmetrics to facilitate long-term sustainable \ndevelopment.\n3.\t Revise liquidity structures for LICs,LMICs, and SIDS, \nespecially regarding sovereign debts, to forestall self-\nfulfilling banking and balance-of-payments crises.\n4.\t Create ambitious and internationally-agreed upon \ncriteria for sustainable finance that are mandatory for \nall public financial institutions in HICs, MICs, and LICs \nalike.\n5.\t Align private business investment flows in all countries \nwith the SDGs, through improved national planning, \nregulation, reporting, and oversight. \n6.\t Reform current institutional frameworks and develop \nnew, innovative mechanisms to improve the quality \nand speed of deployment of international cooperation, \nand monitor progress in an open and timely manner.\n1.

And these IMF estimates \ndo not yet begin to include the full costs of energy \ndecarbonization, climate adaptation, losses and damages \nfrom climate-related disasters, digital access, or urban \ninfrastructure. Adding in these extra needs, the global SDG \nfinancing gap is perhaps US$1 trillion per year, or roughly \n1% of gross world product (GWP) at market prices. As a \nrough rule of thumb based on work by SDSN and the IMF, \nthe LICs need roughly 20% of their GDP in increased SDG \ninvestment outlays while the LMICs need roughly 10%, \nthough precise amounts vary by country. \nTo make sure that existing financial resources and the \nrequired additional resources are used for sustainable \ninvestments, international finance institutions must \nfully incorporate achieving the SDGs and safeguarding \nthe planetary boundaries into their core mandates, and \nmonitor these regarding all countries, poorer and richer \nalike.

The most important component of the stimulus \nplan is a massive expansion of loans by the multilateral \ndevelopment banks, backed by new rounds of paid-in \ncapital by HIC members.

Systems coherence, and ultimate \nsuccess in meeting the SDGs, leads us to the following \nrecommendations:\n1.\t All United Nations agencies should put the SDGs \nat the centerpiece of their strategies, programs, \nand reporting.\n2.\t The World Bank and the other MDBs should \nput the SDGs at the center of their financing \nstrategies, performance reviews, and reporting.\n3.\t The IMF should build its national reviews \n(Article IV), debt sustainability framework (DSF), \nand country programming around the public \npolicies and financing needed for national success \nin achieving the SDGs.\n4.\t The G20 should organize its financial \ncooperation, reporting, and metrics around \nthe reform of the GFA, as needed to achieve \nthe SDGs.\n5.\t All UN Member States should present VNRs \nat least once every three years. It is especially \nurgent that the five countries that have not \nyet presented VNRs should do so no later \nthan 2024.\n6.\t United Nations agencies, multilateral \norganizations, and Member States need to \nincrease investment in, and coordination \nof, national and international data and \nstatistical systems and scientific capacity to \nassess SDG progress and support sustainable \ndevelopment decision making and \ninvestment, including disaggregated data by \nregion, social stratification, and other criteria \nas helpful. \nRegional cooperation and \nsustainable development\nOne of the consistent findings of the SDSN is that SDG \nsuccess requires strong cooperation at the regional level. \nNeighboring countries share ecosystems (rivers, forests, \nfishing zones, wetlands) and must cooperate to protect \nthem. Strong regional partnerships are needed to \nachieve regional objectives. The great seas, such as the \nMediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, are under severe \nthreat from chemical and plastics pollution, and must be \nprotected by all countries whose rivers feed these seas. \nMoreover, regional cooperation is needed to promote \ntechnological and social innovations. For example, the \nMediterranean region is a hot spot for climate change, \nthreatened also by urbanization, economic pressures, \nand geo-political crises.

For all of \nthese reasons and more, neighboring countries must \ncooperate deeply to build infrastructure and share \ndata and knowledge, and to implement sustainable \ndevelopment policies. Regional international policies \nand agreements should be based on available \nscientific knowledge.\nSDSN calls for, and is actively supporting, the devel-\nopment of similar regional-based sustainability plans \nwith associated financing. SDSN is closely following \nand supporting the EU’s endeavors to achieve the \nSDGs, inter alia by the EU’s European Green Deal. The \nEU Green Deal has great potential to bring about \ntransformation both within the EU and beyond, \nincluding the larger European and Mediterranean \nregion, and even Africa. SDSN is working with the \nASEAN Secretariat and member states to help develop \nthe ASEAN Green Deal, introduced in 2022 under the \nASEAN Presidency of Cambodia. SDSN is supporting \nthe African Development Bank to develop a strategic \nplan to accelerate Africa’s sustainable development, \nwith the aim of the African Union achieving high-in-\ncome status and sustainable development by 2063, \nthe 100th anniversary of the Organization of African \nUnity. SDSN is working with the Amazon Basin \nnations, through the Scientific Panel of the Amazon, \nto develop a regional strategy for the conserva-\ntion and sustainable development of the Amazon. \nIn that capacity, the SDSN is also supporting new \npartnerships between the rainforest countries of the \nAmazon Basin, the Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia \nfor a global financing mechanism to protect all three \ntropical rainforest regions. Protection and sustainable \nmanagement of rainforest ecosystems through related \nstandardization will support their impact assessment \non a global basis.\nThe sub-national level \nProvincial, metropolitan, and city governments are \ntypically at the front line in achieving the SDGs. Nearly \n60 percent of the world population now lives in urban \nareas, and that proportion is likely to rise to at least \n70 percent, and probably higher, by mid-century. \nMoreover, cities constitute at least 85 percent of total \nworld output and energy use. What happens in cities will \ndetermine the future of the world, and the success or \nfailure in sustainable development. \nLocal governments have the front-line responsibility \nfor implementing universal health systems, places in \nschool for all children, safe water and sanitation, public \ntransport services, adequate housing, and physical safety \nin the local environment (from crime, toxic wastes, and \nnatural hazards). This is why mayors and city councils \naround the world have rallied to the SDGs, even if their \nlocal leadership is sometimes under-appreciated and \nunder-noted because national governments tend to \nhold the limelight at the United Nations, with the MDBs, \nand in the media. \nCities face one other chronic problem. While they are \nlargely responsible for service delivery, it is national \ngovernments that, by and large, collect revenue to fund \npublic investments and social services. Cities are therefore \ncaught between front-line responsibility and back-of-the-\nline access to the necessary public financing. \nSDSN recognizes this gap in the practical means of \nimplementation of city governments, and is currently \nworking with the major urban think tanks and global \nurban networks (including the C40 and ICLEI) to address \nthe challenge of sub-national financing of the SDGs. \nThis initiative will be launched in Paris in during the June \nSummit for a New Global Financial Pact. \nPart 1.

Peace and \nglobal cooperation must not become mere slogans. They \nare ever more vital to human survival in an age when both \nnuclear weapons and environmental devastation threaten \nthe very survival of humanity. We recall in this context the \npowerful truth spoken by United States President John F. \nKennedy more than 60 years ago, when he declared, “The \nworld is very different now. For man holds in his mortal \nhands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty \nand all forms of human life.” Peace and global cooperation \nmean nothing less and nothing more than choosing the \nend of human poverty over the end of human life. \nWe take note of the dire warning of the Bulletin of Atomic Sci-\nentists, which recently moved the hands of its Doomsday Clock \nto just 90 seconds from midnight, the closest to Armageddon \nin the Clock’s 76-year history; “largely (though not exclusively) \nbecause of the mounting dangers of the war in Ukraine.” We \ncommend global leaders who “oppose the use of or the threat \nto use nuclear weapons”28 and urge all sides to follow this call. \nHad the negotiations underway in March 2022 between \nRussia and Ukraine been successfully concluded, count-\nless lives would have been saved and the devastation of \nUkraine’s cities would have been spared. The world would \nhave escaped the current tumult of soaring food and \nenergy prices and other financial dislocations. We would \nnot be even closer to nuclear Armageddon. \nInternational relations scholars have powerfully described \nthe “tragedy” of great power conflict. They warn that the \njostling for power – or hegemonic domination – ends in \ntragic wars. We cannot afford such a tragedy in our world \ntoday. The world is indeed very different now, as we live \nunder the threat of nuclear war, and even nuclear anni-\nhilation.

From a simple linear projection of past \ngrowth rates, the gap between SDG outcomes in HICs \nand in LICs is expected to be greater in 2030 than it was in \n2015.

The SDG Index and Dashboards\n31   \nAbove all, the SDGs represent an investment agenda: \nto develop physical infrastructure (including renewable \nenergy, electrification, broadband access, public \ntransport) and human capital (health, education, \nsocial protection). Yet many LICs and LMICs face major \nfiscal-space constraints that represent significant \nbarriers to investing in the SDGs, and which the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and other international crises have \naggravated.

SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) calls \nfor ‘policy coherence’ for sustainable development, \nSDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) \nstresses the need for more sustainable production and \nconsumption, and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic \nGrowth) demands the eradication of child labor and \nmodern slavery. The SDSN, working with partners, has \nfrom the start incorporated international spillovers \nin our assessment of countries’ progress towards the \nSDGs. This can explain certain differences in SDG Index \nresults compared with those of other SDG monitoring \ninstruments (Lafortune et al. 2020).\nOverall, HICs tend to generate the largest negative \nspillovers, due to unsustainable consumption, financial \nsecrecy, and the presence of tax havens. Spillover \nindicators are included in calculating the SDG Index \nand individual goal scores and dashboards, and are \nalso aggregated in a stand-alone international spillover \nindex. Figure 2.12 compares international spillover \nindex results by income level. This year, we included an \nadditional indicator that tracks cases of modern slavery \nembodied in international supply chains, building on a \nstudy published in 2022 (Malik et al. 2022). Major updates \nto indicators related to financial secrecy have also been \nintegrated, building notably on the work of the Tax \nJustice Network. \nEnvironmental spillovers are driven to a large extent \nby inadequate pricing of environmental externalities, \nparticularly natural capital. One step in the right \ndirection is the growing adoption of the System of \nEnvironmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) – an \ninternational statistical standard for natural capital \naccounting (UN DESA 2022). A second major driver of \nsuch spillovers is the fact that countries design their \nnational policies to meet national objectives that \nmay not incorporate the need to reduce spillovers \nand to safeguard the global commons. This makes \nenvironmental spillovers hard to address. SDG 17 \n(Partnerships for the Goals) calls on all countries to \nenhance policy coherence for sustainable development \n(PCSD), yet we still lack a robust and comparable \nheadline indicator of countries’ efforts to implement \nPCSD, despite the efforts of UNEP and the OECD to \ndevelop a methodology (UNEP and OECD 2022). A \nrecent analysis led by SYSTEMIQ, the University of Tokyo, \nand SDSN identifies four major national policy levers \nto curb international spillovers: target setting, public \nmanagement, regulation, and fiscal policy and financing.\nFigure 2.12 \nSDG Index scores versus International Spillover Index scores, by income level \nHigh-income countries\nUpper-middle-income countries\nLower-middle-income countries\nLow-income countries\nSDG Index 2023\nInternational Spillover Index 2023\nFrom 0 (worst) to 100 (best)\nFrom 0 (worst) to 100 (best)\nNote: The list of 13 indicators included in this year’s International Spillover Index is accessible online.  \nSource: Authors’ analysis 2.",

Long-term investment plans are \nessential for national success in meeting the goals. There was no expectation in 2015, when the SDGs and \nAgenda 2030 were adopted, that all goals and targets would be achieved at their midpoint. However, by \n2023, one would expect that most countries would have implemented ambitious policy, regulatory and \ninvestment frameworks compatible with achieving major SDG transformations. It could also be expected that \nall countries would have at least once documented their progress and their plans for achieving the SDGs in a \nVoluntary National Review (VNRs) presented at the United Nations.\nThis section discusses government commitment and \nefforts for the SDGs. It captures something different from \nthe SDG Index. A country facing a large gap to conquer \non the SDG Index may have introduced ambitious \npolicy frameworks that are likely to lead to future SDG \nbreakthroughs – especially if these policies and planned \ninvestments are supported by adequate financing. As \nsuch, this assessment of government commitment and \nefforts for the SDGs is more “forward-looking”. Compared \nwith outcome statistics, however, input and process \nstatistics are less internationally standardized and rely on \nmore qualitative information and expert judgement. \nNation-states continue to hold the primary responsibility \nfor achieving the SDGs. This section focuses primarily \non the executive branch at the federal/national level, \nalthough we briefly discuss how regions and cities can \nalso use the SDGs as a strategy and monitoring frame-\nwork. Other SDSN reports discuss subnational SDG \nprogress and challenges at length. Building on earlier work \nconducted by the SDSN (Sachs et al, 2018–2022; Lafortune \net al, 2022), we conceptualize government efforts for the \nSDGs using a three-pillar framework: (1) political leader-\nship and institutional coordination; (2) SDG integration in \nsectoral policies and long-term pathways; and (3) commit-\nment to multilateralism under the UN Charter (see Figure \n3.1). For each pillar, we present proxy indicators that build \non a combination of qualitative survey tools, third-party \ndata, and data scraped from online institutional resources. \nWe include results for each pillar, which we aggregate into \nan overall score for “government efforts and commitments \nfor the SDGs”. Building on close cooperation with SDSN \nnational and regional networks and other partners, we \ncover this year 74 countries from various income groups \nand world regions.\nA detailed database and additional technical information \nare available online. This remains largely a work in \nprogress, and we welcome feedback and comments on \nthe selected indicators and methodology (see more at \nwww.sdgtransformationcenter.org). \n3.1 Political leadership and \ninstitutional coordination: \nresults from the 2023 SDSN \nsurvey of government efforts \nfor the SDGs\nThe SDGs have a significant impact on public \nmanagement practices and procedures (SDSN and \nOECD, 2019). Every year since 2018, SDSN has called on \nits global network of experts to track public statements \nby governments and their strategic use of public \nprocesses to support the SDGs. This information is \ncollected through a survey of national coordination and \nimplementation mechanisms at the central/federal level \nof government. The survey evaluates whether the SDGs \nare used and mentioned in official speeches, strategies, \nmonitoring systems, budgets, and other public processes. \nIt provides an overarching assessment of national/\nfederal government efforts to embrace the SDG agenda \nwhich is complemented by a more granular assessment \nof the alignment of sectoral policies, regulations, \nand investments for the SDGs (presented in the next \nsub-section).

It includes all G20 \ncountries, most OECD members, most countries with \na population greater than 100 million inhabitants, and \nseveral LICs, LMICs, UMICs, HICs, and SIDS. Overall, these \n74 countries represent nearly 85 percent of the world’s \npopulation. Survey results are presented in Table 3.1. Data \nwere collected and analyzed in close partnership with \nSDSN’s global network, and results have been shared with \nUN Permanent Missions for comment prior to publication.\nThe key finding from this survey is that, seven years after \nthe adoption of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, most \ngovernments have signaled “soft” SDG integration into \ntheir public management practices and procedures – \nalthough there is significant variation across countries \n– yet “hard” SDG integration is generally missing, including \nthe use of the SDGs to support long-term budget and \ninvestment frameworks. By July 2023, all UN Member \nStates will have presented a VNR except for Haiti, \nMyanmar, South Sudan, the United States and Yemen. \nMost VNRs identify SDG priorities and actions within \ncountry borders, but fail to accurately capture efforts to \ncurb negative international spillovers and the potential \ntransboundary impacts of their policies. In general, \nour findings echo other research published over the \npast twelve months, showing continued gaps in SDG \nleadership and institutionalization (Biermann et al, 2022; \nKotzé et al, 2022; IGS, 2023). Further integration of goal-\nbased sustainable development into public management \nprocesses, supported by long-term, science-based \npathways, remains a top priority in most countries if they \nare to achieve SDG breakthroughs by 2030 and beyond.\nOfficial high-level speeches and the preparation of VNRs \n(as the official government-led process to report on SDG \nprogress, gaps, and policy efforts) provide relevant proxies \nto gauge political commitment to the SDGs.

Government Efforts & Commitments \n51   \n3.1 Political leadership and institutional coordination: results from \nthe 2023 SDSN survey of government efforts for the SDGs\nwhen only 57 percent of surveyed countries had done so \n– and since 2016, 188 UN Member States have prepared \nVNRs (see Figure 3.2). Forty countries have committed \nto submitting a VNR this year: two will be presenting a \nVNR for the first time, 37 for the second time, and one for \nthe third time. Two countries – Togo and Uruguay – have \nsubmitted four VNRs since 2016. Two non-UN-members \n(the European Union and Palestine) have or will also \nsubmit VNRs. At the midpoint of the 2030 Agenda, only \nfive countries have never submitted a VNR, among them \nthe United States (HLPF, 2023). \nOn institutional coordination, we find that a large \nmajority of countries have appointed a lead unit or \nagency to coordinate the SDGs, but only around a third \nof the countries surveyed locate this unit at the center \nof government (in cabinet offices or within the offices of \nthe President or Prime Minister) (Figure 3.3). The majority \nposition it in a central ministry (of economy, planning, \npublic administration, or environment, for example), while \nSpain has a dedicated Ministry of Social Rights and the \n2030 Agenda. The survey does not evaluate, in practice, \nthe effectiveness and influence of such coordination \nmechanisms and units in driving a whole-of-government \napproach to SDG implementation. \nA large majority of governments – 83 percent of those \nsurveyed – have published some form of strategic vision \nand/or action plan to implement the goals. For many, \nthis takes the form of a national sustainability strategy \nexplicitly linked to the 2030 Agenda goals and targets. \nSome countries take a mainstreaming approach, where \nSDGs are implemented by each government ministry \nwithin the scope of its mandate (instead of via an \noverarching national action plan). The mainstreaming \napproach was used by the European Union, which also \nadopted the European Green Deal as its main strategic \nroadmap for achieving sustainable development. Our \nsurvey cannot evaluate the breadth or actualization of \nthese strategic visions and action plans, although SDSN \nhas published a detailed analysis of SDG integration \nin post-COVID-19 recovery and resilience plans in the \nEuropean Union (Lafortune et al., 2021). The next sub-\nsection goes beyond references to SDG and describes \npersistent gaps in sectoral policy measures for major SDG \ntransformations in greater detail. \nMost countries surveyed had also defined SDG monitoring \nsystems. More than two-thirds (68 percent) have adapted \nthe SDG framework to their context and identified a set \nof nationally relevant indicators. Often these are aligned \nwith official United Nations SDG indicators or represent \na subset of them. Some countries have also developed \nlocalized indicators that account for country contexts. \nFor example, France has a national dashboard of 98 SDG \nindicators, adopted after several rounds of consultations, \nwhich includes indicators that go beyond the official \nUN SDG indicator framework. France also contributes to \nglobal statistical efforts by working with UN agencies to \nreport data points across all 231 official global indicators. \nAn average of 136 indicators are included in national \nframeworks for monitoring the SDGs. Many countries have \nalso developed online platforms to report on progress \ntowards the goals. The survey does not evaluate the \nintegration and influence of such monitoring tools within \nbroader policy, regulatory, and budget cycles, however \nit has recently been suggested that SDG monitoring \nframeworks so far suffer from insufficient linkages to \npolicy implementation as well as low overall visibility \n(Lepenies et al, 2023). Supreme audit institutions and \nparliamentary processes have also been used in some \ncountries to track efforts to implement the SDGs (Office of \nthe Auditor General of Canada, 2018 and 2021; INTOSAI, \n2019; European Parliament, 2022).\nAs in previous years, there is some discrepancy between \nexpressed political support for the SDGs and integration \nof the goals into strategic public policy processes, espe-\ncially long-term budget and investment frameworks. A \nlittle over a third of governments surveyed (36 percent) \nmention the SDGs or use related terms in their latest \nofficial budget document. Among these 27 countries, \nless than half go beyond this to include the SDGs in a \ndedicated section, budget lines, or allocation. Some \ncountries specifically refer to the SDGs in their national \nbudget to support domestic SDG implementation \nnationally (including through national health, edu-\ncation, social protection, or economic development \nreforms), abroad (for example, in aid allocation or \nforeign policy), or both. Looking ahead, establishing \nstronger connections between SDG gaps, targets, \nmonitoring systems, and multi-year budget allocations \nremains an important priority. Part 3.",

    "text": "54   \nPart 3. Government Efforts and Commitments\nAs G20 countries represent two-thirds of the world’s \npopulation and 85 percent of global GDP, integrating \nthe SDGs into their governance systems is particularly \nimportant. Compared with other countries, G20 countries \ntend to lag in several aspects of institutional leadership for \nthe SDGs, including explicit political support in speeches \nand monitoring and coordination mechanisms. The \nintegration of the SDGs in national budget processes could \nbe strengthened in most countries, and especially in LICs \nand LMICs, where less a third of the countries surveyed \nrefer to the SDGs in their national budgets – either in the \nnarrative or as a dedicated section or budget line. \n3.2 SDG integration into sectoral \npolicies and pathways: \nscorecards for the Six SDG \nTransformations \nThe SDGs require long-term directed change, with long-\nterm investment plans essential for national success in \nmeeting the goals. SDSN has recommended six inter-\nrelated long-term transformations: \n1.\t Universal quality education and innovation-based \neconomy\n2.\t Universal health coverage \n3.\t Zero-carbon energy systems\n4.\t Sustainable ecosystems, sustainable agriculture, and \nclimate resilience\n5.\t Sustainable cities\n6.\t Transformation to universal digital access and services\nEach of these challenges requires large-scale public \nand private investments to mid-century. Each requires a \ntechnological transformation. Each requires a financing \nstrategy to underpin the investment plans and monitoring \nsystems. None can be solved by the private sector alone. \nGovernments must take the lead in all six areas to design \npolicy and financial frameworks within which business \ncan profitably invest and innovate. \nBuilding on the work of previous Sustainable Development \nReports, we present here an updated and improved \nversion of the SDG Transformation scorecards, to evaluate \nhow the SDGs are being integrated into sectoral plans. \nEach scorecard consists of a collection of headline policy \nand investment measures to track SDG implementation. \nThese scorecards complement the SDG Index, which is \nbased on outcome data (for example, on poverty rates, life \nexpectancy, and CO₂ emissions). At the international level, \nsuch measures of outcome tend to present significant time \nlags: they may not adequately reflect the impact of trans-\nformative policies and investments that governments have \nintroduced since the adoption of the SDGs, and which \noften yield results only in the medium or long term. The \nscorecards instead focus on the enabling legal, regulatory, \nand investment conditions needed to achieve the SDGs \nand the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement.\nThis exercise has several caveats and limitations. First, \ninternationally comparable policy trackers and measures \n(such as laws, regulations, investments, and subsidies) tend \nto be less available than international outcome data. They \nrely on more qualitative methods and require an advanced \nunderstanding of policy areas and country policies and \ncontexts (generally, more comparable policy trackers \nand measures are available for OECD countries than for \nothers). Second, policy efforts need to be interpreted with \nan understanding of national challenges and contexts (for \ninstance, the absence of advanced cybersecurity policies \nmatters less in a country with low internet access and poor \ndigital infrastructure). Third, apart from a few exceptions, \ngovernment pledges and policies do not capture their \neffective implementation. And fourth, targets or thresholds \nto gauge policy ambitions are not always clearly defined. \nThe rest of this section provides a brief overview of \ncountries’ policy efforts and commitments relating to \nachieving the six SDG Transformations, and highlights \nwhere more research and policy trackers are required to \nbroaden our understanding of national SDG efforts. We \npresent detailed results for the G20 countries, along with \npopulation-weighted averages by geographic region and \nincome group. Detailed information on indicator sources, \nthresholds and results for all 193 UN Member States are \naccessible online. 3.",

Countries must further \nexpand and transform education systems. SDG target 4.1 \ncalls for universal access to 12 years of free primary and \nsecondary education, with at least 9 years compulsory. \nThis scorecard shows that many countries around \nthe world currently fall short of this target. To reduce \ninequalities, governments also need to expand social \nsafety nets. These should be complemented by anti-\ndiscrimination measures (including those furthering \ngender equality); improved labor standards; and measures \nto end all forms of modern slavery, trafficking, and child \nlabor. Investments in research and development will also \nhelp to promote economic growth, which can contribute \nto reducing inequalities. \nLooking ahead, a lead global indicator must be \nestablished to assess country efforts to strengthen their \npopulation’s and students’ knowledge of sustainable \ndevelopment and their ability to navigate an information-\nrich environment. This is important to achieve long-term \nscience-based transformations of all economies, and to \nbuild up public support and accountability. According to \nthe OECD, only one in 10 students in OECD countries can \ndistinguish between fact and opinion (OECD, 2018). \nTransformation 2: Universal health \ncoverage \nThis Transformation promotes key investments in health \nand well-being. It aligns closely with SDG Target 3.8, \nachieving universal health coverage and ensuring that \nall people have access to the health services they need. \nIn the SDGs, universal health care (UHC) is considered a \ntarget in itself. For the SDG Transformation scorecards, \nhowever, we consider UHC an enabler (input) for greater \nhealth outcomes. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, the \nWHO and other international institutions had lamented \nthe slow pace of progress towards achieving universal \nhealth coverage (WHO, 2019). Compared with the rest \nof the world, a higher percentage of people in OECD \ncountries tend to be covered by public or mandatory \nprivate health insurance, and incidence rates of \ncatastrophic out-of-pocket health expenditures are lower \n– although there are exceptions, including Mexico, Costa \nRica, Poland, and the United States. \nThe SDGs also call on all countries to strengthen their \ncapacities for early warning, risk reduction, and the \nmanagement of national and global health risks (SDG \ntarget 3.d). As a measure of pandemic preparedness, the \nGlobal Health Security Index turned out to be a rather \npoor predictor of effective early response to COVID-19, as \nmeasured by the number of cases and deaths (Lafortune, \n2020), indicating that important factors are at play that are \nnot yet adequately captured by existing policy trackers. \nNevertheless, we have not identified a better policy-\nfocused indicator of pandemic preparedness. In the \ncontext of the High-Level Pandemic Summit to take place \nin September 2023 and the forthcoming global pandemic \ntreaty, it remains vital to define solid international \nmeasures and monitoring systems that can better \ngauge countries’ preparedness for global health security \nthreats. But it is also important to address drivers that \ncan lead to the emergence of new pathogens, including \nenvironmental drivers, through “One Health” approaches \n(Sachs et al, 2022; McKee et al, 2021).

The Climate Action Tracker, an independent scien-\ntific analysis of governments’ climate actions, finds that no \nsingle G20 country has adopted a sufficient mix of policies \nand actions to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement objec-\ntives, with only the United Kingdom reaching an “almost \nsufficient” level of policy (Climate Action Tracker, 2022). \nMany countries continue to provide substantial subsidies \nfor fossil fuels, undermining their initiatives to decarbonize \nthe energy system, such as the United States’ Inflation \nReduction Act (IRA) and the European Union’s Net Zero \nIndustry Act (NZIA) (DGAP 2023). While comparable coun-\ntry-level data are not yet available, the IEA has concluded \nthat global fossil-fuel consumption subsidies rose sharply \nin 2022, as governments attempted to shield consumers \nfrom rising energy bills (IEA 2023, OECD 2022).\nTransformation 4: Sustainable \necosystems, sustainable \nagriculture, and climate resilience\nUnsustainable consumption is strongly interconnected \nwith diets, land-use policies, and the health of major \necosystems. This is why Transformation 4 calls for \nintegrated transformations to address dietary shifts, \nbiodiversity, agricultural systems, and land-use policies. \nBringing these elements together is a main difference \nbetween the Six Transformations and the “six entry \npoints for action” presented in the Global Sustainable \nDevelopment Report (GSDR, 2023), which treats “Sustainable \nFood Systems and Healthy Nutrition” and the “Global \nEnvironmental Commons” as two separate entry points. \nToday’s land-use practices and food systems have led to \npersistent hunger, malnutrition, and obesity. They account \nfor a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, over 90 percent \nof scarcity-weighted water use, most biodiversity loss, \nthe overexploitation of fish populations, eutrophication \nthrough nutrient overload, and the pollution of our water \nand air. Food systems are also highly vulnerable to climate \nchange and land degradation: integrated strategies are vital \nto ensure that these systems, along with land-use practices \nand ocean ecosystems, are sustainable and healthy for \npeople. The Convention on Biological Diversity, adopted \nin December 2022 during the 15th Convention of Parties in \nCanada, calls to protect and conserve at least 30 percent \nof terrestrial, inland water and coastal and marine areas by \n2030, “especially areas of particular importance for biodiver-\nsity and ecosystem functions and services” (UN, 2022). \nUNEP estimates that 84 percent of Parties to the UN \nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have \nnow adopted climate adaptation plans, strategies, laws, \nand policies (UNEP, 2022). But there is a significant gap in \nfunding these measures. Annual adaptation funding needs \nare expected to reach US$160 billion to US$340 billion by \n2030, and US$315 billion to US$565 billion by 2050 (UNEP, \n2022). Establishing mechanisms to ensure that the burden \nof financing human-induced adaptation is shared fairly and \nglobally, and that the countries responsible pay the costs \nof loss and damages, remains an important priority for the \ninternational community.\nThe SDSN is highly committed to supporting global \nand national efforts to develop sustainable food and \nland systems, preserve major ecosystems, and ensure \nadequate finance for nature and climate adaptation. \nIn close collaboration with the Food and Land Use \nCoalition (FOLU), the SDSN’s FABLE and FELD projects \nprovide support for long-term, sustainable food and \nland use pathways and policies. Despite the recognized \nimportance of decarbonizing agriculture and enhancing \ncarbon sinks towards achieving the objectives of the \nParis Climate Agreement, FELD recently documented the \nlimited integration of food and land policies into NDCs \n(FELD, 2022). Other flagship projects include the Global \nCommons Stewardship Initiative (led by the Center for \nGlobal Commons at the University of Tokyo in cooperation \nwith SDSN and other partners) and the Science Panel for \nthe Amazon (CGC, SDSN and Yale, 2023; CGC, SYSTEMIQ, \nSDSN et al, 2022). Considering the complexity and far-\nreaching nature of this Transformation, we are not yet in a \nposition to present a scorecard for Transformation 4. Part 3.",

SDSN is working with local partners to \nstrengthen policy frameworks in regions and cities, and \nto reinforce the science-policy interface at the subna-\ntional level.\nIn early 2023, the OECD, SDSN, and the European Committee \nof the Regions (CoR) conducted a survey to take stock of city \nand regional SDG progress. Previous surveys on the topic \nwere conducted by the OECD and the CoR in 2019 and 2020. \nTransformation 6: Universal digital \naccess and services\nArtificial intelligence and other digital technologies \nare disrupting almost every sector of the economy: \nagriculture (precision agriculture), mining (autonomous \nvehicles), manufacturing (robotics), retail (e-commerce), \nfinance (e-payments, trading strategies), media (social \nnetworks), health (diagnostics, telemedicine), education \n(online learning), public administration (e-governance, \ne-voting), and more recently, clerical, drafting, research \nand creative work (generative AI), as well as other fields in \nscience and technology. \nDigital technologies can raise productivity, lower produc-\ntion costs, reduce emissions, expand access, dematerialize \nproduction, improve matching in markets, enable the use \nof big and unconventional data, and make public services \nmore readily available. They can also improve resource-\nuse efficiencies, support the circular economy, enable \nzero-carbon energy systems, help monitor and protect \necosystems, and assume other critical roles in support of \nthe SDGs. Yet the disruptive nature of new technologies \ncalls for deliberative exchanges and consultations with \nmultiple stakeholders and careful assessment of distribu-\ntional impacts and trade-offs.\nCountries face different challenges depending on the \nmaturity of their digital infrastructure and technologies. \nLess-connected countries especially need to invest to \nprovide widespread, affordable internet access and \npromote digital literacy. Yet issues surrounding privacy, \ncybersecurity, e-government, digital inclusion, and the \nrobustness of digital regulatory frameworks concern \nall countries. \nThe Transformation 6 scorecard builds on the World \nBank’s Digitalization for Development policy framework \n(World Bank, 2022). It aims to capture efforts made \nto strengthen digital infrastructure, data security, and \ngovernment platforms and services, as well as the \npromotion of key enablers such as digital literacy and \nprivacy and inclusiveness (including bringing a social \nand gender perspective to digital and technology \npolicies). For now, the scorecard captures a subset of \nthese different elements: we aim to improve coverage \nover time. UN DESA’s Online Services Index assesses the \nquality of government provision of online services; \nthe ITU’s ICT Regulatory Tracker is a composite score \nof regulatory and competition framework for the \nICT sector; UNCTAD’s Global Cyberlaw tracker maps \nlegislation on e-commerce, consumer and data \nprotection and cybercrime; and, finally, the Inclusive \nInternet Index’s policy score assesses a set of policies \non digital inclusion for women and children and safety \nand privacy, as well as policies aiming to increase \nbroadband and 5G access.\nFurther analyses will be needed to capture policies and \nregulations supporting “last-mile inclusion”, particularly \nin relation to financial services and digital literacy, \nand participation and trust in digital institutions (BCG \n2020, Morell-Ducós 2021, Shree, S., Pratap, B., Saroy, R. \n2021, CGAP/World Bank 2020).

Government Efforts & Commitments \n63   \n3.3 Support for multilateralism \nunder the Charter of the \nUnited Nations \nAchieving the SDGs requires global cooperation under \nthe UN Charter. The Charter, signed in 1945, is the \nfounding document of the United Nations. It codifies \nthe major principles of international relations, from the \nsovereign equality of States to the prohibition of the \nuse of force in international relations. Climate change, \npeace, cybersecurity, reliable data and information, and \npandemic prevention and response all depend on close \ncollaboration across countries and a strong multilateral \nsystem, while global supply chains and financial flows \ncan either support or undermine countries’ efforts to \nachieve the SDGs. The 2015 Declaration, Transforming \nour world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \nrecalls that:\n“Seventy years ago, an earlier generation of world \nleaders came together to create the United Nations. \nFrom the ashes of war and division they fashioned \nthis Organization and the values of peace, dialogue \nand international cooperation which underpin it. \nThe supreme embodiment of those values is the \nCharter of the United Nations.”\nThe SDGs are not only a public policy framework; they \nare an ethical imperative grounded in the Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights, which celebrates its 75th \nanniversary this year. The SDGs are based on the core \npremises of the Universal Declaration, that, “All human \nbeings are born free and equal in dignity and rights \n… and should act towards one another in a spirit of \nbrotherhood,” and that “it is essential to promote the \ndevelopment of friendly relations between nations”. In \n2022, the United Nations Secretary-General appointed a \nHigh-Level Advisory Board on Effective Multilateralism, \nwith a mandate to develop a list of concrete, actionable \nrecommendations to improve international cooperation \nand advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment. We therefore consider that promoting \nmultilateralism and global cooperation under the UN \nCharter is an important component of countries’ efforts \nand commitments for the SDGs.\nThis section is an attempt to take stock of countries’ efforts \nto adhere to the values and principles of multilateralism \nin order to achieve sustainable development. To our \nknowledge, there is currently no overarching measure \nthat captures the many dimensions of support for \nmultilateralism. The International Peace Institute’s 2022 \nIndex of Multilateralism explored the state of multilateralism \nglobally, but it did not compare country engagement \n(IPI, 2022). Other reports focus on mapping the size of \ndiplomatic networks or measuring specific aspects of \nmultilateral efforts (e.g., peace or official development \nassistance). The assessment presented this year is a pilot \nthat we aim to improve and expand in coming years. We \nwelcome comments and feedback. \nWe present a variety of proxy indicators to gauge countries’ \nratification of UN treaties, their membership in UN \ninstitutions, unilateral sanctions they have adopted against \nother UN Member States, and their efforts to promote \nglobal solidarity – including international financial flows \n– and peace. In most cases, we aim to capture the latest \nperiod (2018–2022) or the latest available data points. \nThe variables related to the ratification of treaties and the \nadoption of unilateral coercive measures cover 1946–2022 \nand 1950–2021respectively. This assessment is based \non UN databases and several third-party sources. For \npresentational reasons, the tables and charts cover only \nOECD, G20, and large economies. The full database and \nadditional material are accessible online. \nPercentage of UN Treaties ratified: This indicator covers \nall Conventions, International Conventions, and Agreements \nadopted by the United Nations from 1946–2022, including \nthose adopted before 1946 that were later added to the \nUN Treaty system. It excludes Protocols, Optional Protocols, \nand Amendments, as well as Conventions that were later \nterminated or only applied to a small number of countries. \nFor each of the 150 treaties, we recorded whether Member \nStates had signed or ratified them. Signature of a treaty is \nnot legally binding, whereas ratification (or acceptance, \naccession, definitive signature, and succession) is legally \nbinding. The indicator for the percentage of UN treaties \nratified (all international) shows the percentage of these \n150 treaties that each Member State has ratified, whereas \nthe percentage of UN treaties ratified (selective) indicator \nshows the percentage each country has ratified of a select 3.",

The famous 1977 United \nNations Security Council Resolution 418 unanimously \nimposed a sanctions regime against Apartheid South Africa. \nThe data on UCMs presented in this report come from the \nDrexel Global Sanctions Database (V3, March 2023), which \nprovides information on sanctions adopted against other \ncountries, including the beginning and final year of sanction \nimposition. Here we present sanctions adopted unilaterally \nfrom 1950 to 2021 that are still in place as of 2022.

    "text": "3.4 Government effort and commitments for the SDGs: overall scores\n3. Government Efforts & Commitments \n71   \n3.4 Government effort and \ncommitments for the SDGs: \noverall scores\nBuilding on the Six Transformations scorecards, the SDSN \nsurvey of government efforts for the SDGs, and a subset of \nvariables related to government support for multilateralism \nunder the United Nations Charter, we present here overall \nscores rating government efforts and commitment to the \nSDGs. These scores range from 0 (very low SDG commit-\nment) to 100 (very high SDG commitment) and cover all \n74 countries in the 2023 SDG Policy Coordination Survey \npresented in section 3.1, including all G20 members and \nmost OECD countries. Scores draw on 29 indicators of \npolicy efforts and commitment. Since the 2022 pilot, we \nhave added four new indicators on digitalization and five on \nengagement with multilateralism. We have also made some \nmethodological changes: these are explained in greater \ndetail in a technical annex available online, which also \ndiscusses the full list of indicators, the weighting scheme \napplied, and various sensitivity tests used in developing \nthese scores. We welcome critical comments and feedback \nthat may help to strengthen future iterations of this work.\nAt the midpoint of the 2030 Agenda, we draw five major \nconclusions from this comprehensive assessment of \npolicy efforts and commitment to the SDGs (Table 3.6). \nFirst, government efforts and commitment to the SDGs \nremains far too low. The average score of the 74 countries \nassessed is 56 percent, with none even close to obtaining \na perfect score. Second, there are major differences across \ncountries. Four European countries stand out as being \nvery committed to the SDGs (Finland, the Netherlands, \nSweden, and Switzerland), but scores among the G20 \ncountries range from 77 percent in Indonesia to less \nthan 40 percent in the Russian Federation and the \nUnited States. Third, of the three pillars, scores are on \naverage lowest for the second one, related to adopting \nand implementing SDG policies and pathways. This is \ndriven in part by the moderate or low performance of \nLICs and LMICs on this pillar, as these countries may lack \nthe financial resources needed to successfully adopt and \nimplement SDG investments and pathways. The HICs’ \nsomewhat better performance on pillar 2 is largely due \nto their strong performance on the education, health and \ndigital scorecards. More ambitious policies and actions \non climate and decarbonization are needed. (This year’s \nedition does not track efforts on sustainable food and \nland-use transformation, which is an important research \nagenda at the SDSN.) Fourth, LICs and LMICs score more \nhighly on political leadership and institutional leadership \nfor the SDGs than HICs. Fifth, all countries can do more to \npromote multilateralism, in line with the United Nations \nCharter. Argentina, Barbados, Chile, Germany, Jamaica \nand Seychelles score highest for their efforts to promote \nmultilateralism, yet no country obtains a perfect score.\nSome countries perform significantly better on SDG gov-\nernment efforts and commitment than would be expected \nfrom their 2015 baseline level of SDG achievement and \nGDP. We assume that rich countries with high educational \nlevels and good health and infrastructure systems would \nhave greater access to capital to invest in SDG transfor-\nmations. Yet government efforts for the SDGs in 2023 \ncorrelate only moderately to their 2015 SDG Index scores \nand per-capita GDP in 2015. Benin, Ghana, Indonesia, \nNigeria, and Senegal are just some of the countries that are \nperforming much better on the SDG government effort \nmeasure than would be predicted from their baseline SDG \nIndex levels and 2015 per-capita GDP. In contrast, a few \ncountries with very high per-capita GDPs (US$50,000 and \nabove) and SDG Index scores (75 percent and above), such \nas Australia and the United States, demonstrate only a \nlimited commitment to the SDGs, with apparently limited \nefforts made. See additional material available online. \nNote that this score focuses on federal or national govern-\nment efforts for the SDGs and may not be representative \nof initiatives and policies adopted at subnational levels – in \nregions, provinces, metropolitan areas, and cities. It has \nbeen SDSN’s privilege to also work with municipal and met-\nropolitan area associations in the United States and Brazil \n(ICS and SDSN, 2021; Lynch et al., 2019). \nAt this midpoint of the 2030 Agenda, all countries, richer \nand poorer alike, should use the half-way momentum to \ncritically review and revise their national strategies, taking \nthe 2030 Agenda principles as a yardstick (transformative, \nintegrated, inclusive, leaving no one behind). International \nfinancing flows should be aligned with countries’ SDG \nneeds as well as their commitments.",

The resolution also calls for broader \nmeasures of progress to complement GDP. \nThanks to the work of the United Nations Inter-Agency \nand Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDG), countries \nhave adopted a common monitoring framework \ncomprising 231 indicators, for which 219 have data as \nof October 2022.1 Gaps remain that limit our capacity \nto track SDG progress, and the IAEG-SDG continues to \nactively expand coverage where national data is missing, \ndeveloping new methods, identifying new sources to \ndisaggregate the indicators by key population groups \n(such as by gender), and creating indicators to measure \nprogress in local areas. The Cape Town Global Action Plan \nfor Sustainable Development Data, released in South Africa \nat the first United Nations World Data Forum in January \n2017 and adopted by the UN Statistical Commission, \nprovides a strategic vision to strengthen data systems for \nAgenda 2030 (HLG-PCCB 2017).2\nSince its inception in 2012, the SDSN has incorporated a \nstrong focus on data and scienced-based pathways for \nsustainable development. In 2015, the SDSN Leadership \n1.\thttps://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/meetings/iaeg-sdgs-meeting-13/8_\nData-availability-review.pdf\n2.\t https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/hlg/Cape_Town_Global_Action_Plan_for_\nSustainable_Development_Data.pdf \nCouncil released its report Indicators and a Monitoring \nFramework for the Sustainable Development Goals: \nLaunching a Data Revolution, directed to the UN Secretary-\nGeneral (SDSN 2015). Through its flagship initiatives, \nincluding the SDG Index and the Thematic Research \nNetwork on Data and Statistics (TReNDS), the SDSN works \nclosely with many partners to support global, national, \nand local efforts to leverage the SDGs as a monitoring and \naccountability tool. The SDG Index is, by design, a measure \nthat goes beyond GDP. Building on more than ten years of \nwork, this chapter discusses lessons learned from SDSN’s \nflagship initiatives on data and statistics, identifying key \npriorities for improving the availability, quality, and use of \ndata for sustainable development.\n4.1 The SDG Index: a tool for guiding \nSDG action and strengthening \naccountability\nMeasuring sustainable development: why the \nSDG Index? \nPrior to the SDGs, there was already a vast body of \nliterature on how to define and measure sustainable \ndevelopment (Brundtland 1987; Dasgupta and Mäler \n2000; Stiglitz, Sen, and Fitoussi 2009; Arrow et al. \n2013). The adoption of the SDGs and the Paris Climate \nAgreement in 2015 established a shared vocabulary for \nsustainable development, oriented towards Agenda 2030, \nwith the Paris Agreement aiming for climate-neutrality \nby 2050. In comparison to previous international \ndevelopment agendas and goals, such as the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), the SDGs incorporated \nfrom the start a strong focus on targets, indicators, and \nmonitoring – notably via the annual Voluntary National \nReview (VNR) process. The IAEG-SDG, which has operated \nunder the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) Part 4.",

    "text": "78   \nPart 4.Lessons Learned and Next Steps\nsince 2015, was tasked to develop and implement the \nglobal indicator framework for the SDGs. The global \nindicator framework was adopted by the General \nAssembly on 6 July 2017 and is refined and reviewed \nannually. The framework currently includes 231 unique \nindicators (248 when including indicators that repeat \nunder two or three different targets). \nIndicators provide data in specific areas, but they do \nnot give us an aggregate measure of a country’s SDG \nperformance (Schmidt-Traub et al. 2017). The SDGs include \n169 targets and 240 indicators, which is complex to digest \nfrom an operational point of view. Composite indices, \nhowever, despite their well-known shortcomings, allow \nus to synthesize complex information and may be more \neffective in stimulating public debate than a large number \nof individual scores that could result in cherry picking \n(OECD and JRC 2008). Widely used composite indices \ninclude the Human Development Index, the Environmental \nPerformance Index (Wolf and Emerson et al. 2022), and \nthe Better Life Index (OECD 2022a). The SDSN and partners \nhave argued since 2017 that a combination of composite \nSDG metrics and dashboards is needed at the global, \nregional, and subnational levels to inform policies towards \nachieving complex integrated goals (Schmidt-Traub et al. \n2017; Lafortune and Schmidt-Traub 2019). These metrics \nand dashboards can be combined with other instruments \n(from forward-looking models to policy trackers towards \ndeep decarbonization and sustainable food and land \nsystems) to increase accountability and guide action on \nkey SDG transformations. \nThe SDG Index: method and participative process \nWhen it comes to integrated assessment models and tools \nlike the SDG Index, the process often matters as much as \nthe results. The soundness, relevance, and practical utility \nof such models and tools depend not only on scientific \nrobustness, but also on their ability to generate partici-\npative exchanges, and to connect with policymakers and \nother stakeholders. In the context of SDG monitoring in \nthe European Union, we proposed a framework and set \nof criteria in 2019, in collaboration with the Economic and \nSocial Committee (EESC), to assess “the robustness and \nfitness of SDG monitoring tools” – so that they could serve \nas conversation-openers and contribute, along with other \ntools, to co-creating solutions with policymakers and \nstakeholders (Lafortune and Schmidt-Traub 2019). \nThe SDG Index measures countries’ performance on \nthe 17 SDGs. It both tracks distance to pre-defined \nperformance thresholds (at one point in time) and \nevaluates whether countries are on-track or off-track \n(based on past growth rates extrapolated to 2030). \nBuilding on recommendations made in Launching a Data \nRevolution” back in 2015, the SDG Index includes around \n100 indicators (this year’s edition includes precisely 97 \nglobal indicators), clustered by SDGs and normalized on \na 0–100 scale using a classic min-max function. Scores \nare calculated using the arithmetic mean of normalized \nindicators and presented for each indicator, for individual \ngoals, and for the SDGs as a whole. Performance bounds \nto denote SDG achievement for individual indicators are \nbased on a clear decision tree, similar to the one used by \nthe OECD in its assessment of distance to SDG targets \n(Lafortune et al. 2020; OECD 2019a). The Dashboards \naddress the well-known problem of “compensation” in \nthe construction of composite indices, in which good \nperformance on some indicators compensates for poor \nperformance on others, by focusing on the two lowest-\nscoring indicators under each goal (Lafortune et al. 2018). \nThe SDG Index methodology is fully transparent – and \navailable online. It has been peer-reviewed by Nature \nGeoscience (Schmidt-Traub et al. 2017) and by Cambridge \nUniversity Press. The global edition was statistically \naudited by the European Commission in 2019, who \nrecognized that, “All things considered, the SDG Index is \na noteworthy effort of synthetizing the 17 adopted SDGs \ninto a single figure. Overall, the ranks of the SDG Index are \nfairly robust. The index is anchored on the 2030 Agenda \nfor Sustainable Development adopted by all UN Member \nStates and rigorously follows the same structure of \n17 goals” (Papadimitriou, Neves, and Becker 2019). \nIt also builds on an inclusive and participative process. \nThe SDG Index relies on inputs from the SDSN network \nof experts – the largest global network of scientists and \nexperts mobilized for the SDGs – and other partner \norganizations. Each year, an open online consultation \nis conducted using draft SDG Index results before 4.",

Lessons Learned and Next Steps\n79   \nBox 4.1\t\nGIS for the SDGs: Assessing pedestrian accessibility in urban areas\nIn the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the associated New Urban Agenda, countries agreed to take action \nto provide cities with more accessible, well-connected infrastructure that would bring people into public spaces, and to \nenhance walkability through pedestrian accessibility.\nPedestrian accessibility is the extent to which the built environment facilitates walking access to destinations of interest, \nor the ability of urban residents to access services and opportunities. This metric is particularly useful for assessing spatial \njustice in cities, usually represented by disadvantaged communities being compelled to live in deteriorated urban areas \nthat receive only a small share of public investments, resulting in low levels of accessibility.\nTwo sources of geographically explicit data were used to calculate this indicator. OpenStreetMap was used to collect \ndata on pedestrian infrastructure and geographically allocated places of interest (POI): hospitals, schools, supermarkets, \nrestaurants, schools, etc. Data on population density for each city was retrieved from the European Commission’s \n2020 Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL), covering functional urban areas across the entire world. The GHSL provides \ndata in the form of a 100 meter by 100 meter grid, in which each cell has an associated population-density value.\nTo assess accessibility to services for each urban area, we used network analysis to measure the distance separating each \npopulation cell grid from the closest amenities, divided by category, and considering the street network. This enabled us to \nquantify and map accessibility to urban infrastructure at the street intersection level. For each 100 m2 cell in the population \ngrid data, “walking time” reflects the time that a person residing inside that cell area would take to walk to the closest \namenity from a given category of services, using existing pedestrian infrastructure. \nThe complete methodology, along with results and data visualizations, can be found on the SDG Transformation \nCentre website. Data processing used code written in Python: the code is publicly available on SDSN’s Github page. The \nmethodology for this indicator was adapted and expanded from Nicoletti et al. (2022), “Disadvantaged communities have \nlower access to urban infrastructure.” \nFigure 4.1 \nMap of Lagos, Nigeria, showing the scale at which calculations are performed (100 m2 grid). Part 4.",

The Sustainable \nDevelopment Report 2023 represents, to date, the only publicly available application of this method at a global scale.\nCalculating final country scores relies entirely on geospatial datasets and methods. The key steps of this calculation are: \nmapping all motorable roads, drawing a two-kilometer buffer around them, and determining the percentage of the rural \npopulation that resides within the buffer. \nThe particular challenge of this method lies in assessing whether or not a road provides all-season access. It is clear that \nsimply discounting unpaved roads altogether is not realistic, as those often do provide all-year access to rural populations. \nSince no single, complete and timely road dataset is available to measure road access, several criteria were used to \napproximate a road’s passability: road surface (paved or unpaved), accumulated precipitation, road slope, and data on the \ncountry’s ability to keep roads motorable through infrastructure maintenance budgets (since the latter isn’t available for all \ncountries, GDP per capita was used as a proxy).\nRural areas within the unpaved roads’ buffer zones are assessed on passability criteria, and their populations are scaled \naccordingly. For example, precipitation and slope criteria each represent a multiplying factor that ranges from 50% to 95%: \nif a buffer area is very steep, cliffed, and in a very wet climate, only 25% (50% x 50%) of the rural population accessing that \nroad is considered to have access to it. GDP per capita is used as a correcting factor, as countries with the ability to invest in \nroad infrastructure should be able to keep roads passable despite harsh terrain and adverse climate conditions.\nThe complete methodology, along with results and data visualizations, can be found on the SDG Transformation Centre \nwebsite. Data processing used code written in Python and Javascript: the code is publicly available on SDSN’s Github page. \nThe methodology for this indicator was adapted and expanded from Workman and McPherson (2019), Measuring Rural \nAccess Using New Technologies: Supplemental Guidelines.\nRURAL POPULATIONS \nOUTSIDE ROAD BUFFER\nRURAL POPULATIONS \nINSIDE ROAD BUFFER\nURBAN POPULATIONS\n(NOT COUNTED)\nFigure 4.2  \nDiagram of a motorable road with the two-kilometer \nbuffer applied, identifying rural populations living \nwithin and outside the buffer area\nFigure 4.3  \nExample of the method as applied in \nrural Democratic Republic of the Congo 4.",

Indicator selection and \nperformance thresholds are informed by several rounds \nof consultations with SDSN experts, scientists, and \nthe general public. Around a third of the indicators \ncome from outside official statistics (for example, from \nscientific papers or NGOs). This helps fill data gaps in \nofficial statistics, for instance, in the areas of international \nspillovers, sustainability of diets, or biodiversity. We \nare increasingly using space-based technologies to \nstrengthen data availability and timeliness (boxes 4.1 \nand 4.2). While it takes several years to standardize \ninternational statistics, especially when methods need \nto be designed from scratch, our value-added is to fill \nexisting gaps with third-party data where possible. \nThe SDG Index serves as a conversation opener within \nthe research and policy community. As emphasized in the \nWorld Development Report 2021, “data alone cannot solve \ndevelopment problems: people … are the central actors \ntransforming data into useful information that can improve \nlivelihoods and lives” (World Bank 2021). We partner with \nregional and local organizations to prepare indices and \ndiscuss results. As an illustration, the SDG Index for Europe \nis prepared with and discussed among the members of \nthe European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) – a \nconsultative body of the European Commission that gives \nrepresentatives of Europe’s socio-occupational interest \ngroups (such as business associations, trade unions, and \nNGOs) and others a formal platform to express their points \nof view on EU issues (Lafortune et al. 2022). See Box 4.3 \nfor additional information. Other data initiatives at SDSN, \nincluding the FABLE models for sustainable land-use \nsystems, also rely on inclusive participatory processes, \nsuch as “scenathons” conducted by and with local country \nteams (FABLE 2021; Mosnier et al. 2022).\nFrequent comments received on the SDG Index \nthroughout the years\nThe SDG Index, including its regional and local editions, \nhas been generally well received by the research and \npolicy communities, and it has become the backbone of \nnumerous collaborations with international institutions \nBox 4.3 The long-standing partnership between the European Economic and Social \nCommittee (EESC) and the SDSN to advance policies and data for the SDGs in the EU\nMr. Peter Schmidt \nEuropean Economic and Social Committee (EESC) \nAgriculture, Rural Development and the Environment (NAT) Section, President\nThe European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) has been working together with \nSDSN for several years now, even before the launch of the first edition of the Europe \nSustainable Development Report (ESDR) in 2019. The first ESDR report was based on \nearlier EESC work developed in cooperation with SDSN, on “Indicators better suited to evaluate the SDGs – the civil society \ncontribution”. The ESDR was intended to identify SDG policy gaps within the European Union. It was developed in response \nto the EESC’s call for a monitoring report, to be produced in close collaboration with civil society organizations, that would \ncomplement Eurostat's annual SDG report. \nSince 2019, the EESC has provided the SDSN with civil society perspectives and facilitated contacts and dialogues with \nstakeholders and EU policymakers, thus contributing to both the preparation and the dissemination of the ESDR. Several \njoint meetings and events have been organised in this context. The ESDR has served as a conversation-opener with \nbusiness, trade unions, and NGOs to advance sustainable development policies and make recommendations to EU \nleadership, thereby promoting evidence-based discussions at the EU level. The ESDR has also provided a solid foundation \nof data and information for EU policy-making – it has been cited in landmark documents, such as the first EECS EU-level \nVoluntary Review of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, and has inspired strong and meaningful policy proposals in \nthe Committee’s issued opinions.

Comments \nsubmitted by governments, researchers, and practitioners \neither publicly or privately on the global SDG Index results \nand methodology tend to revolve around four main \nperceived issues: (1) The high SDG Index scores and ranks \nobtained by high-income countries, including European \nnations; (2) Data lags, gaps, and the treatment of national \nestimates; (3) Questions concerning the reliability of non-\nofficial statistics and their legitimacy in the context of the \nSDGs; and (4) The absence of a material footprint indicator. \nOn point (1), our results show that rich countries generally \nperform poorly and are not on track to achieving \nenvironmental goals (SDGs 12–15), and that poor \ncountries need help to combat poverty. Rich European \ncountries top the overall SDG Index. This reflects the \nnature of the SDGs, as European countries, particularly the \nNordic economies, perform strongly on socioeconomic \ngoals, relatively strongly on some local environmental \npriorities (for example, wastewater treatment, air pollution, \nor deforestation), and strongly on public institutions and \nthe rule of law. Yet the SDG Dashboards rate rich countries, \nincluding Nordic countries, at “red” on several SDGs – \nparticularly those related to responsible consumption and \nproduction, climate action, and biodiversity – meaning \nmajor challenges remain (Lafortune, Sachs, and Schmidt-\nTraub 2020). Many rich countries also face a significant \nchallenge in achieving SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), which \nincludes unsustainable agriculture, unsustainable diets, \nand obesity. The stringent grading method used for the \nSDG Dashboards highlights negative environmental \nspillovers that affect climate, biodiversity, or water \nscarcity in other countries. Compared with other SDG \nmonitoring reports, however, the SDG Index generates far \nmore negative scores for rich countries on SDGs 12–15 \n(Lafortune et al, 2020). The most recent European edition \nalso highlights challenges related to the “leave-no-one-\nbehind” principle in Europe, as trends on several indicators \nrelated to inclusion are not moving in the right direction. \nSome commenters have recently pointed out that \na country like Bhutan, which shows remarkable \ncommitment to sustainable development and well-\nbeing (characterized notably by its use of the Gross \nNational Happiness Index), performs less well on the \nSDG Index than, for example, Finland or other Nordic \ncountries. The rate of extreme poverty at US$2.15/day \nis about 6 times higher in Bhutan than in Finland, while \npoverty at US$3.65/day is 15 times higher; Bhutan’s \nmaternal mortality rate (SDG target 3.1), at 60 in 100,000 \nlive births, is more than 7 times that of Finland (8 in \n100,000 live births), while its neonatal mortality rate is \nabout 12 times that of Finland; and the incidence of \ntuberculosis in Bhutan is 47 times higher than in Finland. \nIn Finland, 46 percent of parliamentarians are women, \nwhich is almost three times the rate in Bhutan, where \nonly 17 percent of parliamentarians women. Overall, \nBhutan performs lower than Finland on 14 of the 17 SDGs. \nThe SDG Index acknowledges Bhutan’s recent progress \non many socioeconomic indicators, and calls for global \npartnerships to promote sustainable development \nprogress and financing globally.\nOn point (2), national governments often argue that the \nSDG Index results are biased, due to missing data and \nlags in data reporting. It is true that the results often \nrepresent the performance of the previous governments. \nThere are significant time lags in international statistics, \nthat can exceed two or even three years, as well as \npersisting data gaps in certain countries and country \ngroups. This is partly due to the chronic underfinancing \nof statistics in LICs and LMICs. \nFrom a methodological standpoint, we do have \ntechniques in our methodology to address missing-data \nbias and time lags. Countries are included in the SDG \nIndex ranking only if they have data for at least 80 percent \nof the indicators (and one criterion for indicator inclusion \nis that data must be available for 80 percent of countries \nthat have at least 1 million inhabitants). Some national \nauthorities have in the past asked to incorporate their own \nnational estimates in the SDG Index, to address time lags \nand gaps. However, national estimates cannot be included \nin the SDG Index unless they have been submitted, \napproved, and published by United Nations custodian \nagencies or other data providers. This is essential to \nensure data quality and comparability. We do include \nsome timelier, model-based estimates (for example, for \npoverty or health outcomes) and geospatial data. We \nalso review our indicator selection annually and exclude \nparticularly outdated data points and indicators that are \nnot frequently updated. 4.",

Working closely with its global network of scientists and practitioners, regional and local SDG \nCenters, and other partners, the SDSN has established participatory processes to discuss SDG progress and priorities at regional \nand subnational levels. In comparison to global editions, these allow for more specificity in terms of defining regional pathways (for \nexample, for Africa, Europe, or Latin America) and identifying local priorities and challenges to achieving the SDGs. Compared to the \nglobal edition, the use of regional and national databases for these reports tends to reduce constraints related to data availability \nand timeliness. In total, 30+ global, regional, and subnational editions of the SDG Index have been published, supporting stronger \nmonitoring and policy frameworks for the SDGs.\nSource: Authors’ analysis.

Regional SDG Index editions (for Africa, \nEurope, and Latin America) and subnational editions (for \nprovinces, states, regions, and municipalities) allow the \nindicator selection and policy discussion to be contextual-\nized, and this data tends to be timelier (Box 4.4). In response \nto feedback, since 2018 we have supplemented the SDG \nIndex with other qualitative instruments to gauge govern-\nment efforts and commitment to the SDGs, in cooperation \nwith SDSN’s global network (Sachs et al. 2022; Lafortune, \nWoelm, and Valentiny 2022). Finally, TReNDS and its Data \nFor Now initiative, along with other flagship initiatives at \nSDSN, such as SDGs Today, aim to foster partnerships across \na variety of data providers and users to unlock the potential \nof new technologies. \nOn point (3), in an effort to accurately measure often \noverlooked issues, such as environmental challenges \nand international spillovers, the SDG Index includes \nhigh-quality official and unofficial metrics that fill gaps \nin the official SDG metrics. For example, the SDG Index \nhas included carbon dioxide emissions since its incep-\ntion in 2016, even though a measure of greenhouse \ngas emissions under SDG 13 (Climate Action) was only \nadded to the official list in 2020 (Lafortune, Sachs, and \nSchmidt-Traub 2020). The SDG Index and Dashboards \nalso include unofficial measures of unsustainable \nfishing practices and spillovers embodied in trade and \naim to incorporate more geospatial data to improve \ntimeliness and country coverage. In most cases, these \nindicators went through some form of peer-reviewed \nprocess and have been published in the literature \nwhich provides some guarantees about their quality \nand comparability. Others are widely recognized and \nused measures compiled by Transparency International, \nthe World Justice Project, and Reporter Sans Frontières \n(among others). \nBox 4.5 Cooperation between SDSN and the Government of the Republic of Benin in \nthe context of the issuance of the first African SDG Bond\nH.E. Minister Romuald Wadagni \nMinistre d’Etat, Ministre de l’Economie et des Finances\nIn July 2021, to further the efforts it has made since 2016 to implement the SDGs, \nthe Government of the Republic of Benin issued the first African SDG Bond, \ndedicated to financing projects that would have a significant positive impact on \nachieving the SDGs. Through this innovative financing instrument, Benin mobilized \n500 million euros, with an average maturity of 12.5 years. Within this framework, the \nMinistry of Economics and Finance of the Government of the Republic of Benin has \ncalled upon SDSN to assist in monitoring and evaluating Benin’s SDG progress and \nthe efforts it has made towards the SDGs. \nThe Benin Sustainable Development Report, which was launched at the 2022 HLPF, includes detailed analyses of Benin’s \nperformance, progress, and gaps on the SDGs in comparison to neighboring ECOWAS countries, as well as looking at \ndifferences in SDG performance among Benin’s twelve departments under the “leave-no-one-behind” paradigm.

    "text": "4.1 The SDG Index: a tool for guiding SDG action and strengthening accountability\n4. Lessons Learned and Next Steps\n85   \nOn point (4), some advocate for greater use of material \nfootprint indicators and indicators of natural resource use \n(Hickel 2020). While we agree that material resource use \nand consumption and their impacts on the environment \nare important policy issues, we stand by the decision not \nto include indicators of material footprint or “domestic \nmaterial consumption” in the SDG Index. In their current \nform, these indicators present well-known weaknesses. \nIn particular, they combine by weight vastly different \nmaterials that each have different environmental impacts. \nMoreover, they do not correlate material flows by weight \nwith environmental impacts, which vary tremendously \nacross countries. For example, one kilogram of biomass \nused in a humid tropical country has a different footprint \nfrom the same biomass consumption in a semi-arid \ncountry. As a result, it is very difficult to compare material \nconsumption across countries or to define targets. \nWe recommend instead using the spillover indicators \nincluded in the SDG Index and Dashboards to capture \nunsustainable consumption (Lafortune, Sachs, and \nSchmidt-Traub 2020).\nObserved reuse and impact of the SDG Index\nThe SDG Index is a flagship instrument to promote \nawareness of the SDGs. The SDG Index ranking receives \nwidespread attention from politicians and the media, \nwhich further helps to raise awareness about the SDGs \nand creates a “race to the top.” Increasing awareness at \nall levels is critical to the success of the SDGs, and the \nglobal ranking draws attention to countries’ challenges. \nAs noted in the 2005 World Bank staff report, the main \nadvantage of rankings is that “as in sports, once you start \nkeeping score everyone wants to win.” However, this \nalso creates incentives to “game the system – or corrupt \nit,” (Washington Post Editorial Board 2021), which is why \nthe SDG Index is prepared by an independent group \nof experts and researchers, and its methodology and \ndatasets are fully transparent.\nThe SDG Index is also an accountability tool that \nhelps monitor progress and identify areas that need \nimprovement. It is used extensively by national \ngovernments, civil society, and academia. We estimate \nthat around 40 percent of the VNRs presented at the \nUnited Nations by national governments in 2021 \nmentioned the SDG Index. It was also listed by the \nEuropean Parliament among ten composite indicators \nuseful for policy making (EPRS 2021) and was referenced \nin the Parliament’s first SDG resolution in July 2022 \n(European Parliament 2022). Although it was not \ndeveloped to be a standalone tool to inform investment \ndecisions, the SDG Index is also increasingly used by \npublic and private financial institutions (BPCE 2018). \nAlongside other data sources, it is notably being used \nto monitor the implementation of the first African SDG \nbond, issued by the government of Benin in July 2021 \n(SDSN 2022). See Box 4.5. \nThe Index also helps shed light on certain key topics, \nincluding international spillovers, and can serve as \na basis to identify drivers of success and failure on \nSDG outcomes. For instance, our strong emphasis \non quantifying domestic performance, as well as \nnegative spillovers generated abroad via trade, has \nlikely contributed (alongside many other initiatives) to \nraising awareness in the EU about such spillover effects. \nOur work has been referenced in policy briefs and in \nthe literature (Arunima Malik et al. 2021; A Malik et al. \n2021), a in parliament resolutions and government \nprocesses. In Europe, we partnered with Eurostat to \nimprove the availability of data to track such spillovers, \nbuilding on Multi-Regional Input-Output models, \nwhich is now a core chapter of Eurostat’s SDG report \n(Eurostat 2022). In addition, Box 4.6 describes how the \nSDG Index has been used to explore linkages between \nstructural vulnerabilities and SDG outcomes in SIDS (in \ncooperation with UN Resident Coordinators in SIDS, \nas well as other partners), and to promote ambitious \npolicies and financing frameworks for SDG progress \n(See Box 4.6). \nFinally, the SDG Index contributes to global efforts \nto improve data availability. Over the years, countries \nnoted that certain key data points, notably on SDG10 \n(Reduced Inequalities), were missing in our report. This \nhas led some of those countries to work with the World \nBank and other UN custodian agencies to compile \nthese data. In our experience, missing data in the SDG \nIndex is often perceived by countries as a sign of weak \ndata capacity. Part 4.",

These indicators are \nnow an important part of the evidence underpinning the \nmore than 330 Voluntary National Reviews conducted to \ndate to track countries’ performance towards the SDGs.\nThe contribution of the SDGs towards a universally \naccepted framework for monitoring progress is critical. \nBox 4.6 Partnership between SDSN and UN Resident Coordinators in SIDS\nSimona Marinescu, Ph.D. \nSenior Advisor Small Island Developing States \nUnited Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS)\nAt the request of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), the United Nations \nResident Coordinators serving in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) launched \nan unprecedented cross-country and region joint project to develop the first \nMultidimensional Vulnerability Index (MVI) and to capture inherent vulnerabilities \nhindering SDG progress in SIDS. The MVI is intended to define special \ndevelopment contexts such as SIDS and to complement measures of per-capita \ngross national income (GNI) to enable vulnerable countries to access development financing beyond income graduation. \nThe MVI project was coordinated by the UN Resident Coordinator in Samoa. To ensure consistency in measuring countries’ \ndevelopment progress and to strengthen the robustness of the MVI, the UN Resident Coordinators in SIDS entered into a \npartnership with the SDSN team in Paris that expanded to include other analytical products for SIDS. The MVI was structured \nto capture sources of vulnerabilities that are non-self-inflicted and that generate human and economic losses and hinder \ndevelopment progress. The SDSN experts analyzed correlations between the value of a country’s MVI and its SDG progress \nacross the 17 SDGs as well as goal-specific results. The findings confirmed that the MVI designed in collaboration with SDSN \ncaptures with high precision the vulnerabilities that impede sustainable development progress as measured through the \nSDG Index, with the highest correlations in the areas of poverty, health and education outcomes, food insecurity, climate-\nchange response, and biodiversity loss. \nThe partnership with SDSN continued with the creation of the first SDG financing gap measure to link the MVI to the actual \nfinancing needs of SIDS, and to the finance that must be made available to these countries if they are to be able to achieve \nsustainable development by 2030. \nThe triangle of the MVI, the SDG Index, and the SDG financing gap measure allows the United Nations Resident \nCoordinators in SIDS to identify policies and practices that have led to better SDG progress in countries with similar levels \nof multidimensional vulnerability. Furthermore, measuring SDG financing gaps of countries with similar MVI levels informs \nthe analysis of a country’s development finance model and the quality of the external financing it receives in terms of the \nareas targeted, the programme tools utilized, and the content of work. \nThe collaboration with SDSN is ongoing, with the first SIDS SDG Progress Report to be presented at the SDG Summit in \nSeptember this year. Several iterations of a methodology being developed to measure losses and damages caused by \nclimate change will also inform the upcoming Convention of Parties (COP28) in Dubai in December. 4.",

Lessons Learned and Next Steps\n87   \nPrior to the SDGs, countries lacked a standardized method \nof comparing their development performance with \nthat of their peers across a broad array of development \nobjectives (for example, health, education, climate, ending \npoverty, reducing inequalities, etc.). Nor did countries have \na common language to discuss and share experiences \nwhen tackling these development issues. Furthermore, \nthe SDGs have positively impacted discourse and \nknowledge exchange beyond government officials. Many \ncivil-society and private-sector actors have become SDG-\nconversant, facilitating greater discourse within countries \nacross government and non-government actors.\nIt is difficult to assess whether the adoption of the SDGs \nhas in itself had a positive impact on the quantity and \nquality of international data available for sustainable \ndevelopment. According to the World Bank Statistical \nPerformance Indicators (SPI), the world progressed on \naverage by 2.1 points over the period 2016–2022. The \nannual rate of progress for LICs and LMICs was faster than \nthe world average and the HICs average, which denotes \nsome degree of convergence. Using population-weighted \naverages, LMICs are now performing better than UMICs \non the Statistical Performance Indicators. Progress in \nLMICs since 2016 has been driven by significant improve-\nments in the SPI in some of the largest of these countries, \nincluding Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, \nPakistan, and the Philippines. Part of this progress might \nbe due to investments in data capacities and statistics \nmade during the MDG period. SIDS continue to be, by \nfar, the group of countries with the greatest number of \nmissing data points on the SDG Index – SIDS are missing \n22 percent of SDG Index data on average, with some \nmissing more than 50 percent.\nHICs\nUMICs\nLMICs\nLICs\nWorld \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nFigure 4.4  \nStatistical Performance Indicators (SPI): Overall Score, 2016-2022\nNote: From 0 (worst) to 100 (best). \nSource: Authors’ calculations, based on World Bank Statistical Performance Indicators (2023).

    "text": "88   \nPart 4.Lessons Learned and Next Steps\nThe impact of COVID-19 (and other crises?) on \ndata innovation\nOne hypothesis, previously documented by TReNDS \nin the SDR 2022, is that the COVID-19 pandemic and \npossibly other crises may be important drivers of \ndata innovation and collaboration. The pandemic \ntriggered new intra-governmental collaborations to \nprovide decision-makers with evidence to manage \nthe crisis. Furthermore, having timely and high-quality \ndata became a foundation for resilient and effective \ngovernments throughout the pandemic, forcing \ngovernments to adopt new processes to overcome \nthe numerous obstacles that COVID-19 presented. \nAcross countries, pragmatic decisions have been \nmade: to reprioritize staff and resources in order to \nmodernize data capture methods and processes; \nto use non-traditional data sources to fill data gaps, \nincluding citizen science, social media, mobile, and \nsatellite data; and to enhance data dissemination \nschemes to make it easier for policymakers and the \ngeneral public to consume data. To achieve this \nfeat, countries have embarked on a range of multi-\ndisciplinary and cross-sector partnerships. In many \ncountries, National Statistics Offices (NSOs), were \ninnovators during the pandemic. They engaged in \npartnership activities that were previously few and far \nbetween – working with stakeholders across sectors, \nincluding civil society, the private sector, academia, \nand NGOs – to accelerate data innovations for \npolicymaking and SDG attainment.\nPolicymakers responding to ongoing cascading crises \nare likely to continue the experimental and reactive \napproach to policy development that they adopted \nduring the pandemic, including placing a premium on \ntimelier and higher-quality data. As such, these crises \nare likely to be the primary driver of future innovations \nin data, to design and test public policies and \nprograms moving forward. Thus, multilateralism and \ninvestments in global capacity-building and funding \nfor statistics remain critical for short- and long-term \nimprovements in information and data for sustainable \ndevelopment.\n4.3. Conclusions and next steps\n Building on the past ten years of work, including the SDG \nIndex, TReNDS, and a number of SDSN’s initiatives, we \ndraw five major lessons, which can serve as priorities to \ninform SDG policies and financing. \n1.\t Science-based instruments are needed at all \nlevels to guide SDG action and strengthen \naccountability. There are no magic numbers, but \nrather a suite of tools – including indices, integrated \nassessment models, policy trackers, science panels, \nand geospatial tools – that when combined can \nstrengthen government capacity to implement \nthe SDGs and to target investments. SDSN’s new \nflagship initiative – the SDG Transformation Center \n– aims precisely to provide a suite of science-based \ninstruments and serve as a platform for peer-to-peer \nlearning and exchange among scientists, practitioners, \nand investors on the next generation of SDG policy \ntools, analytics, and long-term pathways. \n2.\t Additional investments are needed in capacity-\nbuilding for statistics. The SDG Index and TReNDS’ \ninitiatives have, for some years now, highlighted \nthe acute and persisting data gaps that prevail at \nthe global level for the SDGs, as well as the need to \naccelerate partnerships and investments in statistical \ncapacity (TReNDS 2019). Although the World Bank’s \nStatistical Performance Indicators show signs of \nimprovements in statistical systems since 2016, poor \nand vulnerable countries (including SIDS) still lack \nthe necessary resources to implement the vision of \nthe 2017 Cape Town Global Action Plan for Sustainable \nDevelopment Data (HLG-PCCB, 2017). According to \nPARIS21, funding for data and statistics fell by almost \nUS$100 million between 2019 and 2021, representing \nthe most significant drop in funding since the start \nof the SDG era (OECD 2022b). And as highlighted at \nthe UN World Data Forum in April 2023 and reiterated \nin the 27 April Hangzhou declaration: statistical \ncapacity in the poorer and most vulnerable countries \nrequires “an urgent and sustained increase in the level \nand scale of investments in data and statistics from \ndomestic and international actors, from the public, \nprivate, and philanthropic sectors” (HLG-PCCB 2023). 4.",

    "text": "4.3. Conclusions and next steps\n4. Lessons Learned and Next Steps\n89   \n3.\t We need to invest in data and science literacy to \nstrengthen the science-policy interface. According \nto major international studies, few 15-year-old \nstudents can tell the difference between a fact and \nan opinion (OECD 2019b). In an information-rich \nand post-truth environment, citizens and decision-\nmakers need knowledge and tools to transform data \nand science into evidence, actions, and long-term \npolicies. Yet UNESCO estimates that there is a nearly \nUS$100 billion finance gap for countries to reach \ntheir education targets (UNESCO 2023). The SDSN \nand its partners are increasingly collaborating with \ngovernments and parliaments – and also working \nclosely with business associations, private financial \ninstitutions, trade unions, and academic organizations \n– to improve data literacy and support science-based \npolicy discussions to advance the SDGs at the national \nand local levels. Strengthening the science-policy \ninterface is key for implementing long-term pathways \nfor sustainable development. \n4.\t Non-traditional statistics and science-based \npathways help to address shortfalls in official \nstatistics; they could be further leveraged to \ninform investment decisions. Developing official \ninternational statistics takes time. Especially when no \nsuitable methodologies or data-collection methods \nexist. Halfway into the SDGs, for instance, we lack a \ngood-quality international metric, available to most \ncountries, to track “mechanisms in place to enhance \npolicy coherence of sustainable development” – \nindicator 17.14.1. Nevertheless, building on the \nimprovements in the field of industrial ecology, the \nSDSN and its partners have included an evaluation \nof negative international spillovers (one component \nof sustainable development policy coherence) in the \nSDG Index since 2017. Non-official sources of statistics, \nsuch as citizen science, social media, earth observation \ndata, artificial intelligence (AI), model-based estimates, \nand other pathways produced by academics and \nresearchers, support greater accountability and can \nprovide a forward-looking evaluation of efforts to \nimplement the SDGs, complementing official statistics. \nAdditionally, initiatives like the Climate Action Tracker \nhelp provide science-based and forward-looking \nassessments of countries’ ambitions and actions taken \nto further key SDG transformations. These types of \nassessments, as well as science-based decarbonization \ntargets and food and land pathways, can be further \nleveraged in the design and assessment of public and \nprivate investment programs for the SDGs, including \nsustainability-themed bonds. \n5.\t Space-based technologies help address data \ngaps and timeliness, including supporting the \n“leave no one behind” principle; they can be \nfurther leveraged via global partnerships. Time \nlags in international data reporting can exceed two \nto three years, including for key SDG indicators. With \nthe elevated focus on and interest in data, COVID-\n19 has set the stage for new user expectations, with \nmany users – especially the general public – now \nexpecting to obtain data in real time (Sachs et al. 2022). \nThe global community has mobilized space-based \ntechnologies to help provide more timely and granular \ninformation on the state of the global commons, or \non access to key services (among others). In Europe, \nfor instance, Copernicus, the EU’s flagship Earth \nObservation and Monitoring program, was mobilized \nearly on to improve SDG data availability, timeliness, \nand granularity. And the new SDGs-EYES program \nwill establish “an integrated scientific, technological \nand user engagement framework, overcoming the \nknowledge and technical barriers that prevent the \nexploitation, combination and cross-feeding of data \nand tools” to support SDG action. At the global level, \nUN-GGIM and the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) \naim to reduce the technical and legal barriers to using \ngeospatial data and to strengthen multistakeholder \npartnerships. And TReNDS’ Data for Now initiative is \nworking to support countries’ capacity to deliver robust \nand timely data to achieve the SDGs through user-\ncentric approach, multistakeholder partnerships, and \nuse of alternative data sources, including space-based \ntechnologies. The “TReNDS Data for Now” initiative \ndraws on a user-centric approach, multistakeholder \npartnerships, and the use of alternative data sources \nsuch as space-based technologies to build countries’ \ncapacities to deliver accurate and timely data to \nachieve the SDGs.",
