Unlocking the power of data for sustainable development
Accurate, timely and disaggregated data are vital for measuring progress 
towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 associated 
targets. Data help identify challenges, formulate solutions, monitor 
implementation and make needed course corrections. Without high-quality 
data providing an evidence base, it will be impossible to truly understand 
where we are succeeding and falling short on the SDGs. The Sustainable 
Development Goals Report 2024 provides a comprehensive overview of 
the world’s progress nine years into the journey to 2030. Using the latest 
available data, the report highlights both successes and challenges as the 
international community strives to fully realize the ambitions and principles 
of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The progress assessment carried out in 2024 reveals that the world is 
severely off track to realize the 2030 Agenda. Of the 169 targets, 135 can be 
assessed using available global trend data from the 2015 baseline to the most 
recent year, along with custodian agency analyses; 34 targets lack sufficient 
trend data or additional analysis. Among the assessable targets, only 17 per 
cent display progress sufficient for achievement by 2030. Nearly half

Due to new data and revised methodologies, this year’s progress assessment is not comparable to those of previous years.
(48 per cent) exhibit moderate to severe deviations from the desired 
trajectory, with 30 per cent showing marginal progress and 18 per cent 
moderate progress. Alarmingly, 18 per cent indicate stagnation and 17 
per cent regression below the 2015 baseline levels.1 This comprehensive 
assessment underscores the urgent need for intensified efforts to put the 
SDGs on course. Detailed analysis by target can be found at the end of this 
report.
SDG progress assessment is affected by ongoing challenges in the 
availability and timeliness of data to monitor all 17 Goals. Overall, 
commendable progress has been made in improving internationally 
comparable data for SDG monitoring. In 2016, when the global indicator 
framework for the Goals and associated targets was initially adopted, only 
about one third of indicators had good data coverage (that is, data were 
available for more than 50 per cent of countries), and 39 per cent of the 
indicators lacked internationally established methodologies or standards. 
Today, 68 per cent of indicators have good data coverage. Since 2020, 
all 231 indicators have had well-established and internationally agreed 
methodologies. Good trend data are available for 51 per cent of the indicators 
(at least two data points since 2015) in more than half of all countries.
The variance in country data coverage plays out differently across the Goals, 
with major shortfalls in priority development areas, such as gender equality 
(Goal 5), climate action (Goal 13), and peace, justice and strong institutions 
(Goal 16). Moreover, data timeliness remains a challenge. Approximately one 
third of indicators lack data for the past three years, hampering the ability of 
policymakers to make timely informed decisions and course corrections.

Unlocking the power of data
Robust data build on a strong statistical foundation, innovation and integration
A strong statistical foundation draws on both traditional and innovative 
data sources. Traditional data sources include censuses, surveys and 
administrative data. Population censuses provide crucial data for national 
and subnational planning and also serve as denominators for numerous SDG 
indicators. Household surveys contribute data for about one third of SDG 
indicators, according to the Inter-Secretariat Working Group on Household 
Surveys. Birth and death registrations are vital for accurate population data 
and ensure individuals’ legal rights, providing essential documentation for 
accessing health care, education and inheritances. 
Many countries still face challenges, however, in building a robust statistical 
foundation with data from these three traditional sources. In 2022, overall 
performance on them across countries averaged around 0.6 (out of 1). 
Notable disparities existed across countries. High-income countries 
achieved nearly a full score for birth and death registration; upper-middle-
income countries had an average score of 0.7; low- and lower-middle-
income countries scored only 0.2. Disparities in censuses and surveys 
based on income level also persist, with scores from 0.5 to 0.8, although 
differences were less pronounced.
Data demand for SDG monitoring has spurred innovation and the integration 
of different data sources. For instance, Azerbaijan uses remote sensing to 
monitor the coverage of important sites for mountain biodiversity (SDG 
indicator 15.4.1). Colombia and Malaysia have integrated geospatial and 
population data to estimate the proportion of the rural population living 
within 2 kilometres of an all-season road (SDG indicator 9.1.1). Bangladesh 
has employed geospatial and survey data to generate local poverty estimates 
to inform government policies. Ghana and the United Kingdom have tapped 
into citizen science data to monitor marine litter (SDG indicator 14.1.1). 
Kyrgyzstan’s statistical office collaborates with a network of civil society 
organizations to explore how citizen data can support the Voluntary National 
Review. Both the Netherlands and Uruguay monitor air pollution with 
national networks of sensors (SDG indicator 11.6.2). 
Countries worldwide are recognizing the need to invest in national statistical 
systems to produce high-quality, timely data for SDG monitoring. This 
involves not only financial resources but also requires building capacity, 
modernizing infrastructure and adopting international statistical standards. 
As countries continue to strengthen statistical foundations, embracing 
innovation and integrating diverse data sources and methodologies will be 
critical in overcoming challenges such as declining response rates as well as 
in fostering collaborative partnerships.

Engaging citizens in data production is essential to leave no one behind 
The overarching principle of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 
is to leave no one behind. A comprehensive review by the Gender Data 
Compass, however, revealed significant gaps in disaggregated data for 
key social, economic and environmental indicators disseminated online 
by national statistical offices (NSOs). In 2023, the availability score for 
sex-disaggregated data ranged from 23 to 83 out of 100. Sex-disaggregated 
data were most available for indicators on demographics, migration, 
fertility and reproductive health (with a score of 83) and least available for 
environmental indicators (23).
Further disaggregation by additional characteristics resulted in a significant 
decrease in data availability. For example, the availability score for 
demographic and migration indicators dropped to 34 when including 
disaggregation by sex and other non-geographic characteristics. Subnational 
data availability was notably low, with average scores ranging from 3 to 
34. Interestingly, high-income countries generally exhibited lower overall 
disaggregated data availability compared to low- and middle-income 
countries.

Ensuring that no one is left behind calls for more than just data 
disaggregation. Uncovering the intersectional disadvantages faced by the 
most marginalized groups demands additional efforts. For example, a side 
event on citizen data at the fifty-fifth session of the United Nations Statistical 
Commission showed that indigenous women and girls with disabilities 
in Bolivia faced significant challenges in accessing reproductive health 
information and care. Addressing these challenges and formulating relevant 
policies to overcome them is possible only when citizen data are collected 
with the active involvement and support of communities with firsthand 
knowledge of their own needs.
Involving citizens in data production signifies a shift towards a more 
collaborative and participatory model of governance, marking a new chapter 
in the social contract between State institutions and citizens. This refreshed 
dynamic embodies principles of transparency, participation and shared 
responsibility, reflecting an evolving relationship where citizens are not just 
subjects of governance but active participants in it. The newly proposed 
Copenhagen Framework on Citizen Data by the Collaborative on Citizen 
Data supports such engagement.
Data openness has improved; use and impact need more work 
The increased openness, accessibility and effective use of data have been 
crucial to better data impact. Since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, 
countries have made significant progress in opening up official statistics for 
public use. According to Open Data Inventory, the average score on data 
openness for around 180 countries and areas increased from 44 in 2017 to 
55 in 2022. The openness level was greater in high-income countries, with a 
score of 67 in 2022, compared to only 42 for low- or lower-middle-income 
countries. This score represents official statistics that are machine-readable, 
non-proprietary, have an open data licence or open data terms of use, 
include available metadata and offer accessible download options.
Data openness does not always translate into effective use and impact, 
however. Monitoring these dimensions has been challenging. The 
Statistical Performance Indicators framework covers data use by national 
legislatures and executive branches, civil society, academia and international 
organizations, but only data use by international organizations is available. 
More efforts are needed to strengthen data use and impact, and measure 
and document results.

The role of national statistical offices as data stewards is evolving but challenges in data governance 
remain   
Successful SDG monitoring requires NSOs to play a strong stewardship role 
within the national data ecosystem. According to a 2023 survey on data 
stewardship, nearly all NSOs reported having the mandate to coordinate 
the production and integration of official statistics across the national 
statistical system. Perceptions of successful data stewardship, however, 
varied. While almost 90 per cent of NSOs agreed that increased data 
sharing and reuse within the national statistical system were top priorities, 
they did not universally recognize active engagement with census and survey 
respondents, media interaction and improved data literacy as indicators of 
effective stewardship. 
Ensuring data privacy and security is crucial in today’s world, with data 
produced by both State entities and non-State actors, such as the private 
sector and civil society organizations. Surprisingly, only 30 per cent of NSOs 
considered this aspect important in their data stewardship role. This finding 
is consistent with responses to another survey question on which entities 
are responsible for different aspects of official statistics. While 80 per cent 
of NSOs either led or co-led technical and statistical standard-setting, only 
50 per cent played a role in data security. This underscores the urgent need 
to establish national data governance systems that go beyond the current 
scope of NSO activities.

Unlocking the power of data
Strengthening partnerships is key to more inclusive data  
Building partnerships with diverse stakeholders makes SDG monitoring more 
inclusive and incorporates different perspectives and needs. According to 
a 2022 survey on the implementation of the Cape Town Global Action Plan 
for Sustainable Development Data, 81 per cent of NSOs had institutional 
arrangements with the public sector, followed by international organizations 
at 66 per cent, academia at 56 per cent and the private sector at 45 per cent. 
Partnerships between NSOs and civil society organizations stood at 37 per 
cent. A similar trend was observed in the production of gender statistics, 
with government ministries being the most common partners. Around 90 
per cent of NSOs had established regular or ad hoc collaborations with 
other government entities, compared to only 37 per cent with civil society 
organizations. 
As more countries recognize the importance of adopting a “whole-of-
society” approach to achieve the ambitious goals of the 2030 Agenda, 
increased efforts are being made to acknowledge the contributions of civil 
society. For example, with support from the Collaborative on Citizen Data 
and the United Nations country team, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics is 
establishing a formal partnership with civil society organizations to produce 
and use citizen data. This initiative represents a significant step for the 
country in recognizing data generated by non-state institutions.
Similar partnerships have flourished globally. At the SDG Summit in 
September 2023, the High Impact Initiative on the Power of Data was 
launched. It aims to deliver data needed to achieve the SDGs by mobilizing 
political support and investments in national data systems, fostering unified 
national data strategies, and strengthening partnerships, collaboration and 
coordination. The expanding initiative currently comprises 15 countries 
across Africa, Asia and Latin America and Caribbean. More countries and 
partners are encouraged to join this important effort to ensure that every 
government has data to monitor and drive SDG progress. 
Partnering with local governments enables NSOs to gather more 
accurate, comprehensive and context-specific data, enhancing the overall 
effectiveness of SDG monitoring and the responsiveness of development 
efforts to local priorities. According to the 2023 data stewardship survey, 49 
per cent of NSOs had established a formal process or dedicated position for 
collaborating with local officials; 27 per cent had organized ad hoc meetings 
for such collaboration; 24 per cent either had rare or no arrangements or did 
not respond to this question on the survey.
Coordinated efforts can close funding gaps and boost national data and statistical capacity  
In 2023, only 65 per cent of countries had fully funded and implemented 
national statistical plans. The funding gap is more pronounced in low- and 
lower-middle-income countries, where only 35 per cent have sufficient 
funding, compared to only 11 per cent of high-income countries. Forty-five 
countries or areas received funding from donors; half were low- and lower-
middle-income countries. 
In the Hangzhou declaration on accelerating progress on the Cape Town 
Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data, countries agreed on 
“an urgent and sustained increase in the level and scale of investments in 
data and statistics from domestic and international actors, from the public, 
private and philanthropic sectors, to strengthen statistical capacity in low-
income countries and fragile states, close data gaps for vulnerable groups 
and enhance country resilience in the current context of economic crisis, 
conflict, climate change and increased food insecurity.”  
While acknowledging the contribution of development partners in building 
national data and statistical capacity, a holistic approach to such support 
is crucial to prevent silos and duplicated efforts. Effective coordination and 
proper funding allocations between development partners and national 
entities are imperative to systematically address data and capacity gaps. 
Mechanisms such as the Statistical Training Needs Assessment Tool, 
developed by the Global Network of Institutions for Statistical Training, can 
aid in systematically assessing national statistical capacities to guide funding 
allocations. Colombia and Ghana have used the tool to develop plans that 
help prioritize capacity-building needs.

Reduced inequalities
•	
Despite the economic disruptions of the pandemic, the global share of 
people living on less than half the median income has been declining 
due to social assistance programmes. However, workers’ wages have not 
kept pace with productivity, and labour’s share of GDP has resumed its 
long-term decline.
•	
A historic reversal is threatening improvements in inequality among 
countries. The economies of half the world’s most vulnerable countries 
have been growing at slower rates than those of wealthy countries. 
•	
	More people died on migration routes in 2023 than in any other year on 
record. The number of refugees worldwide reached a historic high. 
•	
	Developing countries are not fairly represented in international economic 
decision-making. Strengthening their voice and participation is crucial to 
ensuring a more inclusive and equitable global economic system.
•	
Addressing inequality both within and among countries necessitates 
equitable resource distribution, investment in education and skills, 
social protection measures, efforts to stop discrimination, support for 
marginalized groups, and international cooperation for fair trade and 
financial systems.
The proportion of people living below half the median income is falling globally
Since 2000, two thirds of countries with data have reduced the proportion 
of their population living on less than half the median income. This trend 
continued during the pandemic. Data from 82 countries, representing 70 
per cent of the world’s population, indicate a slight decline in the proportion 
of people living below half the median income post-2019 compared to 
2015–2019, dropping from 12.8 to 12.1 per cent. Progress has occurred in all 
regions except Central and Southern Asia, where the proportion remains 
relatively low at 9 per cent. Social assistance programmes, particularly in 
wealthier countries, largely explain reduced inequality during the pandemic. 
Latin America and the Caribbean has high levels of within-country inequality 
with at least 18 per cent of the population living on less than half the median 
income.

Labour’s share of GDP returns to a long-term decline as capital returns increase
Bucking a downward trend going back to the 1970s, the global labour income 
share of GDP rose sharply during the pandemic from 52.9 per cent in 2019 
to 53.8 per cent in 2020. This increase should not be misinterpreted as a net 
gain for workers. During this period, global labour income decreased by 1.5 
per cent in 2020, while global output fell even more, by 3 per cent. In 2021, 
the labour income share of GDP resumed its long-run decline. 
The labour income share of GDP dropped from 54.1 per cent in 2004 to 52.7 
per cent in 2021, representing a loss of $568 (purchasing power parity) per 
worker. This negative trend implies that rising labour productivity has not 
fully translated into higher labour compensation. Earnings from work are 
particularly important for less well-off and vulnerable people. At the same 
time, returns to capital have been rising, which can increase inequality as 
capital income is concentrated among the affluent.

Half of the most vulnerable countries face a widening income gap with the wealthiest economies
For the first time this century, half of the 75 most vulnerable countries – 
those eligible for concessional lending from the World Bank’s International 
Development Association (or IDA) – are experiencing a widening income 
gap with the wealthiest economies. A quarter of the global population – 
1.9 billion people – live in IDA countries. One in three of these countries are   
poorer than before the pandemic.
Between 2020 and 2024, one in two IDA countries has achieved slower 
growth in income per capita than in the wealthy economies, the highest 
share since 2000. One in four people in IDA countries live on less than $2.15 
a day, an extreme poverty rate that is more than eight times the mean for the 
rest of the world. Ninety per cent of people facing hunger and malnutrition 
live in IDA countries, half of which are in debt distress or at high risk of it.

Developing countries remain underrepresented in 
international economic decision-making
Developing countries make up 74 per cent of United Nations General 
Assembly Members but have limited voice and participation in international 
economic decision-making, norm-setting and governance. At the World 
Bank’s main lending arm, developing countries hold only 39 per cent of 
voting rights, far short of their 75 per cent share of the bank’s membership. 
At the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank’s private sector 
lending arm, developing countries have just over 32 per cent of voting rights. 
The International Monetary Fund completed two general reviews of quotas 
in 2019 and 2023 without any changes to their distribution (which helps to 
determine voting rights), leaving developing countries with only 37 per cent 
of voting rights. Other international financial institutions, such as regional 
development banks, have not undertaken any voting rights reforms since 
2015 or announced plans to do so. The Fourth International Conference 
on Financing for Development in 2025 presents an opportunity to address 
these shortcomings and strengthen the legitimacy of global governance 
arrangements. 
2023 saw the highest number of refugees and was the deadliest year on record for migrants
By end 2023, a record 37.4 million refugees under the mandate of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) remained forcibly 
displaced from their countries due to war, conflict, persecution, human 
rights violations and events seriously disturbing public order. The number of 
refugees has increased year-on-year for more than a decade and doubled in 
less than seven years, outpacing durable solutions. By the end of 2023, 461 
of every 100,000 people worldwide were refugees, more than double the 213 
per 100,000 people at the end of 2015.
In 2023, a tragic milestone occurred as it became the deadliest year on 
record for migrants, with 8,177 fatalities documented. The majority of 
deaths occurred on routes taken by migrants affected by crises. Since 2015, 
over 57,000 migrant deaths have been recorded, although data collection 
challenges and limited responses mean that the actual number is likely much 
higher. The top countries of origin in terms of migrants losing their lives 
have active armed conflicts. They include Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Myanmar 
and the Syrian Arab Republic. Safe and accessible migration pathways are 
imperative as people continue to risk their lives on irregular routes given 
limited alternatives.

Remittance costs have fallen but not enough; 
digitalization could accelerate further decreases
Over the past decade, the cost of remittances has fallen significantly. The 
global average cost of sending $200 decreased from 7.42 per cent in 2016 to 
6.18 per cent in 2023. This is still above the 3 per cent SDG target, however. 
In 2023, the highest costs for sending $200 in remittances were in Oceania 
(excluding Australia and New Zealand) and sub-Saharan Africa, at 8.33 per 
cent and 7.36 per cent, respectively, despite substantial progress in both 
regions since 2011. 
Digital remittance services could help reach the target faster. In 2023, the 
global average cost of digital remittances was 4.84 per cent compared 
to 6.77 per cent for non-digital/cash-based remittances. Digital services 
comprised 30 per cent of all services in 2023. To achieve the SDG target, 
stakeholders could leverage digitalization to reduce costs, increase efficiency 
and improve remittance accessibility. Regulators need to address challenges 
such as limited competition, high compliance costs, account access barriers, 
transparency issues, and low digital and financial literacy.

•	
Over half the world’s population currently resides in cities, yet urban 
areas confront myriad complex challenges. Globally, approximately 
one quarter of the urban population lives in slums, with the total slum 
population reaching 1.1 billion in 2022. The lack of equitable access to 
public transportation is a significant concern, particularly in LDCs, where 
only 4 in 10 individuals have convenient access.

	While air pollution levels have declined in most regions, they are still 
significantly higher than the recommended air quality guidelines for 
public health protection.

With urbanization on the rise and nearly 70 per cent of the global 
population projected to reside in cities by 2050, the development of 
critical infrastructure, affordable housing, efficient transport systems and 
essential social services is imperative to create resilient and sustainable 
cities that meet the needs of all.

A deepening global slum crisis requires urgent action on housing, transportation and services
In 2022, 24.8 per cent of the urban population lived in slums or informal 
settlements, slightly lower than 25 per cent in 2015 but higher than 24.2 per 
cent in 2020. The total slum population was 1.12 billion in 2022, 130 million 
more than in 2015, marking a reversal from the consistent decrease observed 
from 2000 to 2020. The setback was mainly in Eastern and South-Eastern 
Asia (from 21.7 per cent in 2020 to 24.8 per cent in 2022) and sub-Saharan 
Africa (from 50.2 per cent in 2020 to 53.6 per cent in 2022).
Over 85 per cent of all slum dwellers in 2022 were in Eastern and South-
Eastern Asia (362 million), Central and Southern Asia (334 million) and sub-
Saharan Africa (265 million). Projections suggest that sub-Saharan Africa 
will experience the most substantial proportional increase, with an estimated 
extra 360 million slum dwellers by 2030 if current trends persist. This 
emphasizes the urgent need for a comprehensive approach to addressing 
the housing crisis, including through diverse housing options, while achieving 
equitable access to public transportation and essential services.
High rates of unregulated urban sprawl pressure the environment and diminish quality of life
1	
The annual rate of sprawl is calculated as the annual rate of change in built-up areas outside urban boundaries in 2000 (but within 2020 urban boundaries) per city. The 
annual rate of densification is calculated as the annualized rate of change in built-up areas within the 2000 urban boundaries per city.
Urban sprawl is characterized by the unplanned, low-density, uncontrolled 
expansion of urban areas into previously undeveloped rural or suburban 
areas. This unregulated growth has negative impacts on the natural 
environment and land use, contributing to increased air pollution and the 
loss of open spaces, wildlife habitats and agricultural land. Cities sprawled 
or grew outwards up to 3.7 times faster than they densified or grew upward 
from 2000 to 2020, based on recent data from 1,217 cities in 185 countries. 
Globally, from 2000 to 2010, the average annual rate of sprawl reached 5.6 
per cent while the annual densification rate lagged at 1.47 per cent.1  The 
sprawl rate slightly declined from 2010 to 2020, dropping to 3.6 per cent 
annually. Yet the gap with the densification rate, estimated at 0.95 per cent 
annually during the same period, remained substantial. Sustainable urban 
development calls for mitigating the adverse impacts of urban sprawl and 
achieving a balanced approach to urban growth.

Air quality has improved but still falls short in terms of fully protecting public health
Each year, an estimated 4.2 million people die due to ambient air 
pollution. Globally, the population-weighted exposure to fine particulate 
matter (PM2.5) dropped from 39.1 µg/m3 in 2010–2014 to 35.7 µg/m3 in 
2015–2019, a 9 per cent decline. Yet the level remains significantly higher 
than the recommended air quality guideline of 5 µg/m3 for public health 
protection. Eastern and South-Eastern Asia markedly improved air quality 
in 2015–2019, after having the world’s second-highest PM2.5 concentrations 
in 2010–2014. Similar advances in Europe and Northern America highlight 
the positive impacts of international cooperation and legislation, including 
the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. By contrast, 
air pollution in sub-Saharan Africa and Northern Africa and Western Asia 
increased from 2010–2014 to 2015–2019.
Improved air quality monitoring has been instrumental in confirming 
regional successes and informing policy decisions. Between 2011 and 2022, 
monitoring capacity worldwide grew sixfold, although 92 per cent of this 
expansion took place in high- and middle-income countries.
Goal 11 | Sustainable cities and communities
Public transit remains out of easy reach for 40 per cent of urban residents worldwide
Ensuring equitable access to public transportation helps to reduce food 
insecurity, boost economies, empower women, and connect people to 
key health, education and financial services, especially vulnerable urban 
populations. Yet many cities worldwide lack adequate urban transit 
infrastructure. Only 6 in 10 urban residents have convenient access to public 
transit, based on data collected in 2023 from 2,039 cities in 188 countries. 
The shortfall is particularly problematic in the LDCs, where less than 4 in 
10 urban residents have accessible public transportation options, compared 
to 8 in 10 in more affluent regions. Accelerated investments are needed to 
extend public transit services to the most marginalized communities, both 
in developing regions and impoverished urban neighbourhoods in developed 
countries. This effort is essential to foster inclusive urban development and 
improve the livelihoods of the urban poor.

Vibrant cities depend on open public spaces yet too few residents have ready access
Open public spaces in urban areas foster inclusive and vibrant cities. Yet 
only 44 per cent of urban residents have an open public space conveniently 
located within a 400-metre walk, according to 2020 data from 1,365 cities 
across 187 countries. This lack of access disproportionately impacts people 
in the LDCs, where less than 30 per cent of urban dwellers can conveniently 
access open public spaces. Conversely, high-income regions such as 
Australia and New Zealand as well as Europe and Northern America have 
much greater rates of access, with 60 to 70 per cent of urban inhabitants 
living near public open spaces. The data underscore a pervasive global 
challenge. Without concerted efforts, the majority of urban populations will 
struggle to access vital amenities, particularly the most vulnerable residents.

Responsible 
consumption and 
production
•	
Countries have made strides in meeting obligations under international 
environmental agreements on hazardous waste and other chemicals 
and implementing comprehensive approaches to combat environmental 
degradation. Patterns of unsustainable consumption and production 
persist, however. In 2022, global food waste reached 1.05 billion metric 
tons, yet only 9 of 193 countries included food waste in their nationally 
determined contributions (NDCs) on climate change actions. The rapid 
growth of global e-waste remains largely unaddressed, with only 22 per 
cent collected and managed sustainably.
•	
While domestic material consumption and material footprints continue 
to expand, growth rates have slowed. Regional disparities underscore the 
need for targeted interventions based on varying consumption patterns 
and environmental impacts.
•	
Achieving Goal 12 requires fostering circular economy models, 
sustainable production practices and responsible consumption. These 
approaches can take advantage of opportunities at every stage of 
production to reduce resource and fossil fuel use, drive innovation, 
conserve energy and mitigate emissions. Progress largely depends on 
robust regulatory frameworks, financial incentives and public awareness 
campaigns.

after migrating from his village to Accra to engage in e-waste work.
The world wastes 1.05 billion metric tons of food even as hundreds of millions face hunger
In 2021, 13.2 per cent of food produced globally was lost after harvest and 
during transport, storage, wholesale and processing. An alarming 19 per cent 
of all food at the retail or consumption stage was wasted in 2022, totalling 
1.05 billion metric tons of all food available to consumers. Most food waste 
occurred in households (60 per cent); each person wasted an average of 79 
kilograms annually, more than the weight of the average person. Globally, 
an estimated 1 billion meals of edible food are wasted every day, equivalent 
to 1.3 meals per person impacted by hunger per day, considering that 783 
million people faced hunger in 2022.  
Data suggest that household food waste varies by just 7 kilograms per 
capita each year across high-income, upper-middle-income and lower-
middle-income countries. Hotter countries tend to have higher waste per 
capita, possibly due to increased consumption of fresh food with substantial 
inedible parts and inadequate refrigeration. Further, each year, food loss and 
waste generate 8 to 10 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, costing over 
$1 trillion and straining land resources and biodiversity. At the same time, 
as of 2022, only 9 of 193 countries had included food waste in their NDCs, 
revealing a significant gap in connecting this issue with climate action and 
the objective of halving food waste and reducing losses by 2030.
High rates of consumption and insufficient reuse or recycling are producing vast piles of e-waste
Uncontrolled disposal of electronic and electrical equipment fuels vast 
e-waste stockpiles, exacerbated by rising consumption, short product life 
cycles and little repair. E-waste generation rose from 6.3 to 7.8 kilograms 
per capita from 2015 to 2022, reaching a total of 62 million metric tons of 
e-waste in 2022. Only 1.7 kilograms per capita was collected and managed 
in an environmentally sound manner. High-income countries achieved 
collection rates of over 40 per cent, yet most e-waste was inadequately 
recycled or exported to lower-income countries where management 
infrastructure is not developed, inadequate or absent. In Central and 
Southern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa, 
collection rates are below 5 per cent. Inappropriate management by the 
informal sector results in environmental pollution and health hazards for 
workers and communities. 
By 2030, e-waste generation is projected to increase to 10 kilograms per 
capita per year (or 82 million metric tons in total). If all countries boost their 
collection rates to 60 per cent, 54 million metric tons of e-waste would be 
managed in an environmentally sound manner, with 30 million metric tons of 
metal resources viably recovered.  This would also prevent 34,000 kilograms 
of mercury emissions and 209 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent 
emissions in 2030.

Goal 12 | Responsible consumption and production
More countries and companies are stepping up to report on sustainability measures
From 2019 to 2023, 62 Member States and the European Union reported 516 
policy instruments to accelerate the transition to sustainable consumption 
and production patterns. Half the policies are national road maps or 
strategies; 30 per cent are legal instruments; and 14 per cent are voluntary 
instruments. New policies in 2023 integrated sustainable consumption and 
production patterns into high-impact sectors. The Philippines sought to 
promote responsible mining and enhance compliance with environmental 
laws, for instance. The United States planned to transform its food system 
for broader benefits. Australia’s Water Efficiency Labelling and Standard 
Scheme initiated efforts to reduce water demand and encourage efficient 
technologies.
International standard setters have developed sustainability reporting 
standards for both the public and private sectors. While this represents 
positive progress, challenges persist given a lack of interoperability and 
inconsistency in national reporting requirements. In 2021–2022, 73 per 
cent of sampled companies published sustainability reports, triple the 
share in 2016, with growth in all regions. Reporting is more common on 
environmental (water, emissions and energy efficiency) and governance 
(gender diversity, board meetings, bribery and corruption) dimensions than 
on social ones (human rights, health and safety, diversity and opportunity). 
The number of stock exchanges with written guidance on environmental, 
social and governance reporting continues to grow, from fewer than 10 a 
decade ago to 69 in 2022.

Global material consumption growth slows but regional disparities persist 
Domestic material consumption measures materials directly used within an 
economy, including those that are extracted and imported but without those 
that are exported. From 2000 to 2022, domestic material consumption 
grew by 69 per cent, from 56.6 billion metric tons to 96.0 billion metric 
tons. The compound annual growth rate slowed, however, from 3.9 per cent 
in 2003–2012 to 0.8 per cent in 2013–2022. The global material footprint, 
representing raw materials extracted to meet final consumption demands, 
increased by 71 per cent from 57.4 billion metric tons in 2000 to 98.0 billion 
metric tons in 2022. Its compound annual growth rate declined from 3.9 
per cent in 2003–2012 to 0.9 per cent in 2013–2022. Structural shifts in the 
composition of the material footprint stem from escalating reliance on non-
metallic minerals and the diminishing relative impact of biomass. 
In regions where the material footprint exceeds domestic material 
consumption, the latter decelerates faster, notably in Eastern and South-
Eastern Asia, Europe and Northern America, and Northern Africa and 
Western Asia. In these regions, the compound annual growth rate of the 
material footprint declined from 3.7 per cent to 0.8 per cent from 2003–2012 
to 2013–2022, while the domestic material consumption rate dropped from 
3.9 to 0.5 per cent. In regions where the material footprint is lower than 
domestic material consumption, including Central and Southern Asia, Latin 
America and the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, the compound 
annual growth rate decreased from 4.5 to 1.3 per cent for the former and 
from 3.8 to 1.6 per cent for the latter from 2003–2012 to 2013–2022. 
A widening regional gap between the two indicators signifies varying 
environmental pressure from material consumption.
Monitoring tourism in line with sustainable development is progressing yet more is needed
National monitoring based on the Tourism Satellite Accounts and the 
System of Environmental Economic Accounts provides a good indication 
of a country’s capacity to measure the economic and environmental 
sustainability of tourism. In 2019, a record 99 countries used at least one 
table under the accounts for evaluating key tourism sustainability indicators. 
A subsequent decline in use from 2020 to 2022 was likely due to a natural 
lag in data production. While global monitoring capacities have improved 
across all regions since 2008, in most, less than 50 per cent of countries can 
report data.

Reaching the $100 billion climate finance goal is a milestone yet trillions are needed for national action 
plans
Climate finance is crucial in backing global mitigation and adaptation 
efforts. Developed countries committed to mobilize $100 billion annually 
in climate finance for developing countries by 2020 and through 2025. The 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports 
that the commitment was met for the first time in 2022. Climate finance 
increased by 30 per cent from 2021 to reach $115.9 billion in 2022, with 60 
per cent of the total allocated to mitigation. Total adaptation finance rose to 
$32.4 billion from $10.1 billion in 2016. The 2021 Glasgow Climate Pact urged 
developed nations to double adaptation finance to developing countries from 
2019 levels by 2025. Based on OECD figures, by 2022, developed countries 
were approximately halfway towards meeting this goal.
Negotiations are under way to establish a new climate finance goal from 
2025 onwards, starting from a floor of $100 billion annually, and taking into 
account developing countries’ needs and priorities. The United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) estimates that nearly 
$6 trillion is needed for developing countries’ climate action plans by 2030, 
underscoring the need to massively scale up finance.
Climate action
•	
Climate records were shattered in 2023 as the climate crisis accelerated 
in real time. Rising temperatures have not abated and global greenhouse 
gas emissions continue to climb. Communities worldwide are suffering 
from extreme weather and increasingly frequent and more intense 
disasters, destroying lives and livelihoods daily. Meanwhile, fossil fuel 
subsidies hit a record high. 
•	
The global community faces a critical juncture. All countries must 
urgently speed up economy-wide, low-carbon transformations to 
avoid escalating economic and social costs. The upcoming 2025 cycle 
of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) presents a chance for 
ambitious climate action plans that drive economic and social progress.
These must have increased ambition to close implementation gaps, 
cover entire economies and all greenhouse gases, and align with the 
target of limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C. 
•	
The road map to halting warming at 1.5°C and avoiding the worst of 
climate chaos is clear but cannot afford any delays or half measures. 
Drastic reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions must take place 
by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.
Young climate activists stand on an artificial beach in Malé, Maldives, 
highlighting messages urging climate action.
Highest-ever greenhouse gas emissions reveal a global failure to meet climate goals
In 2022, global greenhouse gas emissions reached a new record of 57.4 
gigatons of CO2 equivalent, according to the United Nations Environment 
Programme’s Emissions Gap Report 2023. About two thirds of emissions 
comprised CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes. Except 
transportation, emissions from all major sectors have rebounded since the 
pandemic and now exceed 2019 levels. The energy sector, responsible for 
86 per cent of global CO2 emissions, remains the largest contributor, driven 
by the expansion of coal- and gas-fired power generation. Governments plan 
to produce around 110 per cent more fossil fuels by 2030 than would be 
consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C.
Keeping warming to 1.5°C calls for a 42 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030, requiring an 8.7 per cent annual decline. For a 2°C limit, 
a 28 per cent drop by 2030 is necessary or a 5.3 per cent annual decrease. 
The only comparable fall was by 4.7 per cent during the pandemic from 2019 
to 2020.
Current national policies set the world on track for warming of 3°C. NDCs 
lower this to 2.5°C, while all net-zero pledges would put warming at 2°C, 
although these pledges are highly uncertain. There is currently only a 14 
per cent chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C, underscoring the urgency of 
immediate, accelerated action to significantly cut emissions this decade.

Another broken record – 2023 was the warmest year yet
The world continues to shatter temperature records. The World 
Meteorological Organization (WMO) confirmed that 2023 was the hottest 
year on record, with global average temperatures soaring to approximately 
1.45°C above pre-industrial levels. The 10 warmest years in the 174 years 
with records have all occurred during the last decade. Extreme weather 
events, including heatwaves, major floods, droughts, wildfires and tropical 
cyclones, have disrupted the lives of millions of people and caused billions of 
dollars in economic losses.
As of June 2024, a WMO climate update underscored an 80 per cent 
likelihood of at least one year temporarily exceeding 1.5°C from 2024 to 
2028. In 2015, the probability for such a temperature spike was near zero. 
The global mean near-surface temperature for each year from 2024 to 2028 
is predicted to be 1.1°C to 1.9°C higher than the 1850–1900 baseline. At least 
one of the next five years will likely surpass 2023 as the warmest on record.

Fossil fuel subsidies hit a historic high globally in 2022, exceeding $1.5 trillion
Fossil fuel subsidies reached a record high of $1.53 trillion in 2022, driven 
by rising energy prices post-pandemic and the impact of the Russian 
Federation’s invasion of Ukraine, which disrupted global energy markets. 
The increase widened the gap between consumer prices and actual energy 
costs, prompting many governments to introduce support measures to 
shield industries and populations from inflation. Public funds shoring up 
the production and consumption of oil, coal and gas more than doubled 
between 2021 and 2022, and more than tripled from their 2015 levels, 
reversing progress made between 2012 and 2020 and hindering the net-zero 
transition. 
All regions saw higher subsidies between 2021 and 2022, with the highest 
in Europe and Northern America ($455 billion), followed by Northern 
Africa and Western Asia ($327 billion) and Central and Southern Asia 
($322 billion). By artificially lowering fossil fuel prices, subsidies harm the 
competitiveness of cleaner energy sources and hinder the low-carbon 
transition. They strain national budgets, especially in countries facing 
fiscal constraints and high debt levels. Although intended to aid vulnerable 
households, subsidies often disproportionately benefit wealthier people, who 
consume more energy than lower-income households, as well as carbon-
intensive companies. Despite numerous national, regional and global pledges 
to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, data show minimal action. 
As disasters become more probable, better preparedness has lowered mortality rates
According to the WMO, recorded disasters increased fivefold over the past 
50 years, driven partly by human-induced climate change. The number 
of persons affected by disasters per 100,000 population rose from 1,169 
(2005–2014) to 1,980 (2013–2022), a 69 per cent increase, as reported by 
the Sendai Framework Monitor. The total affected population averaged 133 
million people annually from 2015 to 2022, up from 29 million annually from 
2005 to 2014. If current trends continue, it is projected that 560 medium- to 
large-scale disaster events could occur annually by 2030, an average of 1.5 
per day. 
In LDCs, the disaster-affected population per 100,000 people is 20 per cent 
higher than the global average, and the mortality rate is 170 per cent higher. 
This illustrates that the catastrophic impact of disasters is much greater in 
these countries.
Improved preparedness, including early warning systems and evacuation 
measures, have significantly reduced disaster mortality in recent years. 
Global disaster mortality per 100,000 population dropped by 49 per cent, 
from 1.62 in 2005–2014 to 0.82 in 2013–2022 (excluding COVID-19 related 
cases). This translates to an average annual mortality of 42,553 people 
between 2013 and 2022, a one-third decrease from the annual average in 
2005–2014. National long-term risk reduction strategies and plans, reported 
by 129 countries; the establishment of effective multi-hazard early warning 
systems, reported by 104 countries; and comprehensive resilience plans are 
key to minimizing disaster impacts on people and economies.

Life below water
•	
Oceans face significant challenges from eutrophication, worsening 
acidification, declining fish stocks, rising temperatures and widespread 
pollution. All these factors destroy habitats, diminish biodiversity and 
threaten coastal communities and the health of marine ecosystems, vital 
to over 3 billion people.
•	
Efforts to address these mounting concerns remain uneven. Key actions 
include implementing sustainable fishing practices, expanding marine 
protected areas to safeguard key biodiversity areas, increasing capacities 
to monitor ocean health and addressing the pollution that is choking 
waterways.
•	
Comprehensive global action is under way, yet it must accelerate. 
Priorities include ensuring that the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies 
enters into force as soon as possible; increasing participation in the 
Agreement on Port State Measures to combat illegal, unreported and 
unregulated fishing; adopting a global plastic pollution instrument; and 
ensuring that the Agreement on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond 
National Jurisdiction enters into force as soon as possible to ensure the 
long-term health and sustainability of oceans.

Overfishing, pollution, climate change and poor management drive continued declines in fish stocks  
The sustainability of global fishery resources declined from 90.0 per cent 
in 1974 to 64.6 per cent in 2019 and further to 62.3 per cent in 2021, due to 
overfishing, pollution, poor management and other factors. Fish stocks within 
biologically sustainable levels, however, comprised around 76.9 per cent 
of global marine fish landings in 2021. Averaging 80 million tons annually, 
global marine fish landings have remained relatively stable since 1995.
Trends in 2021 for major fishing regions vary greatly, from 33 per cent to 
84 per cent of fish stocks at sustainable levels (underfished and maximally 
sustainably fished). The Southeast Pacific had the highest percentage of 
overfished stocks at 66.7 per cent, followed by the Mediterranean and Black 
Sea at 62.5 per cent, the Northwest Pacific at 56 per cent and the Eastern 
Central Atlantic at 51.3 per cent. In contrast, the Eastern Central Pacific, 
Northeast Atlantic, Northeast Pacific and Southwest Pacific had the lowest 
proportions of overfished stocks, ranging from 16 to 24 per cent. 
Overfishing can harm biodiversity, ecosystems and fisheries production, and 
imposes adverse social and economic costs. Effective fisheries management 
can possibly reverse these effects (if they are driven by overfishing and 
not factors such as habitat degradation, pollution or climate change) and 
lead to optimal stock levels while supporting global food security and 
coastal communities. The ongoing albeit decelerated decline in biologically 
sustainable fish stocks worldwide underscores the need for enhanced 
regulatory frameworks and efficient monitoring systems.

Sustainable fisheries’ contribution to GDP dropped worldwide yet several regions saw positive trends
The value added of fisheries and aquaculture rose by 10 per cent from 2019 
to 2021. The contribution of sustainable fisheries to GDP declined 5.4 per 
cent in 2021, however, mainly due to the expansion of other economic 
sectors and the declining sustainability of several fish stocks in some 
regions. This marks a second consecutive drop following a brief period of 
growth from 2015 to 2017. Recovery from COVID-19 disruptions has been 
challenging, with the industry facing volatile demand and rising costs. 
Several countries that depend heavily on fisheries for livelihoods and food 
security, however, have seen positive developments. In sub-Saharan Africa, 
the contribution of sustainable fisheries to GDP climbed from 0.38 per cent 
in 2019 to 0.42 per cent in 2021. Small island developing States have similarly 
shown promising growth, from 0.46 per cent of GDP in 2019 to 0.51 per 
cent in 2021. Pacific small island developing States, which rank among the 
countries most dependent on fisheries globally, increased their share from 
1.54 per cent of GDP in 2019 to 1.63 per cent in 2021. This rise underscores 
the sector’s potential to drive economic development. Sustaining economic 
dividends from fisheries, however, requires judicious fish stock management 
practices that prevent overexploitation and depletion.

Global agreements could renew momentum to protect key biodiversity areas in the oceans
As of May 2024, there are 18,200 marine protected areas and 199 other 
effective, area-based conservation measures1 covering over 29 million 
square kilometres or 8.12 per cent of the ocean. This represents a more 
than tenfold increase in marine protected area coverage since 2000, 
largely due to the establishment of very large areas exceeding 100,000 
square kilometres. Progress has stalled since 2020, however. Reaching the 
10 per cent SDG target by 2030 calls for effectively managing important 
sites covering an average additional 1.13 million square kilometres of ocean 
each year. Renewed momentum for marine conservation is expected from 
global agreements. The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework 
commits to establishing protected areas to safeguard areas of particular 
importance for biodiversity, adding up to cover 30 per cent of oceans by 
2030. Additionally, the Agreement on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond 
National Jurisdiction   aims to protect marine biodiversity in international 
waters and seabed. Adequate management of such protected areas will be 
crucial to realize conservation benefits.
Marine designations should be strategically located to safeguard key 
biodiversity areas. Since 2000, average protected area coverage of marine 
key biodiversity areas has nearly doubled, but growth has stagnated since 
2015. From 2000 to 2015, Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) 
saw a staggering 255 per cent increase in key biodiversity area coverage, 
followed by Northern Africa and Western Asia (128 per cent) and sub-
Saharan Africa (86 per cent). Since 2015, sub-Saharan Africa has led with an 
18 per cent increase, followed by Northern Africa and Western Asia 
(10 per cent). Less than 30 per cent of marine key biodiversity areas in 
Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand), Central and Southern Asia, 
and Northern Africa and Western Asia are protected, however, highlighting a 
critical need for action within the next six years.

Record-high ocean temperatures have triggered a fourth global coral bleaching event
Rising ocean temperatures are raising new concerns for coral reefs, which 
support a quarter of marine species, provide resources for hundreds of 
millions of people in coastal communities and generate trillions of dollars 
in revenue annually. According to the World Meteorological Organization, 
as of April 2024, sea surface temperatures had reached record highs for 13 
consecutive months. In 2023, ocean heat content soared to its highest level 
in 65 years; over 90 per cent of the ocean experienced heatwave conditions 
at some point during the year. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration confirms the world is currently experiencing its fourth global 
coral bleaching event, the second in a decade. Bleaching has been observed 
in 53 countries and territories, including throughout the tropics, the Great 
Barrier Reef, large parts of the South Pacific, and the Atlantic and Indian 
ocean basins.
As oceans continue to warm amid rising global temperatures, the frequency 
and severity of coral bleaching will likely increase. The Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change warns that up to 90 per cent of corals could be lost 
by 2050 at 1.5°C of warming and up to 99 per cent at 2°C. The survival of 
coral reefs is vital for ocean health and humanity’s well-being.

Global trends underscore persistent challenges to biodiversity and 
forests, despite their critical roles as planetary life-support systems. 
Global forest area continues to decline, primarily due to agricultural 
expansion, despite notable progress in sustainable forest management. 
Alarmingly, species are silently becoming extinct, the protection of key 
biodiversity areas has stalled and global illicit wildlife trafficking has 
steadily increased, posing serious threats to biodiversity and the benefits 
it provides to people.
•	
Efforts are under way to tackle these challenges, with countries 
advancing implementation of access and benefit-sharing instruments 
and integrating biodiversity values into national accounting systems. 
There’s also a growing global commitment to biodiversity conservation, 
reflected in increased funding and the adoption of the Kunming-
Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.
•	
Urgent action is imperative. Addressing pressing environmental 
challenges and their underlying drivers and interconnections – 
including climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, desertification 
and deforestation – demands intensified, accelerated efforts, and a 
comprehensive and integrated approach at local, national and global 
levels. 
Life on land
Reducing deforestation depends on improving food security, income and land rights
Between 2000 and 2020, the proportion of forest cover decreased from 
31.9 to 31.2 per cent of total land area, resulting in net forest area losses of 
nearly 100 million hectares. Agricultural expansion drove almost 90 per cent 
of global deforestation; cropland accounted for 49.6 per cent and livestock 
grazing for 38.5 per cent. Globally, small-scale farming caused 68 per cent 
of agriculture-driven deforestation, while large-scale farming contributed to 
32 per cent. In Africa, small-scale farming was responsible for 97 per cent 
of agriculture-driven deforestation. Forest losses due to large-scale farming 
were highest in South America at 48 per cent (mainly linked to livestock 
grazing), followed by Asia at 38 per cent (primarily due to large-scale crop 
production, particularly for oil palm plantations).
These findings suggest that efforts to reduce deforestation must tackle 
production system weaknesses while addressing critical needs such as food 
security, income and land tenure rights for local communities. Stemming 
deforestation also demands a comprehensive approach blending regulatory 
measures, market incentives and stakeholder collaboration to promote 
sustainable land management and preserve forest ecosystems.

Risks to species continue to escalate globally
Global biodiversity faces ongoing threats, evidenced by a 12 per cent 
deterioration in the Red List Index between 1993 and 2024. Over 44,000 
species, or 28 per cent of almost 160,000 assessed species, are currently 
threatened. They include 70 per cent of cycads and 41 per cent of 
amphibians. The latter are particularly impacted by climate change, habitat 
conversion and invasive fungal disease. For example, Buckley’s glass frog, 
assessed as Critically Endangered and found only in the Ecuadorian Andes, 
faces increased extinction risk due to habitat loss from expanding agriculture 
and livestock grazing, fungal disease and climate change. Regionally, severe 
biodiversity declines across all species groups are evident in Central and 
Southern Asia as well as in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia. Stopping 
the ongoing decline in biodiversity is an urgent race against time, making 
accelerated conservation efforts imperative to safeguard the irreplaceable 
and intricate web of life on the planet.

The  share of illegally traded wildlife has been on the rise since 2017 peaking during the COVID-19 
pandemic
Illegal wildlife trade persists worldwide despite two decades of concerted 
action at international and national levels and poses a significant threat 
to global biodiversity, endangering a wide range of terrestrial and marine 
species. Illegal trade has affected around 4,000 plant and animal species in 
162 countries and territories from 2015 to 2021. This exploitation jeopardizes 
the survival of species and undermines ecosystem functions, especially when 
compounded by other pressures, such as habitat loss and climate change. 
Recent estimates indicate that the intercepted illegal wildlife trade as 
a proportion of all wildlife trade (legal and illegal) has been on the rise 
since 2017, peaking during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wildlife seizures 
comprised over 1.9 and 1.4 per cent of global wildlife trade in 2020 and 
2021, respectively. Trends likely reflect a disproportionate reduction in legal 
trade during the pandemic and an increase in enforcement efforts for certain 
wildlife commodities. For instance, more wildlife seizures were primarily 
attributed to new regulations targeting high-value timber species from South 
America, alongside intensified enforcement actions.

Detrimental land cover changes are impacting mountain ecosystems
Between 2015 and 2019, at least 100 million hectares of productive land 
were degraded annually, adversely impacting global food and water security. 
This degradation, driven by changes in land use and coverage, significantly 
contributes to biodiversity loss, including in fragile mountain ecosystems. 
The widespread transformation of mountain ecosystems is due to various 
natural and human-induced factors, such as climate change, natural 
hazards, unplanned agriculture and urbanization, timber extraction and 
recreation. Globally, only about a third of mountain key biodiversity areas are 
safeguarded by protected areas or other effective area-based conservation 
measures.
Global data from 2000 to 2018 indicate that degradation affects about 
1.6 per cent of the world’s mountainous areas. The highest proportion of 
degraded mountain land is in the alpine areas of Europe and Northern 
America (2.29 per cent), followed by the montane areas of Central and 
Southern Asia (2.22 per cent) and the lower mountain belts of Eastern 
and South-Eastern Asia (2.17 per cent). Mountain ecosystem degradation 
threatens downstream water provision, through  reduced glacial coverage, 
as well as biodiversity and other ecosystem services, thereby undermining 
efforts to protect terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Furthermore, 
diminished forest and vegetation coverage increase soil erosion, heightening 
the risk of downstream landslides and flooding.

Note: Mountains can be subdivided vertically into seven bioclimatic belts based on average 
temperatures, which helps account for latitudinal changes in the elevation of thermally similar 
areas in the world’s mountains. This facilitates global comparisons. Indicator 15.4.2 aggregates 
seven bioclimatic belts into four (nival, alpine, montane and remaining mountain areas).

•	
Rising conflicts and violent organized crime persist around the world, 
causing immense human suffering and hampering sustainable 
development. The number of forcibly displaced people reached an 
unprecedented 120 million in May 2024. Civilian casualties in armed 
conflicts surged by 72 per cent in 2023.
•	
Corruption continues to divert resources from sustainable development, 
with one in five people reporting being asked to pay or having paid a 
bribe to a public official in the last 12 months. With one third of prisoners 
unsentenced worldwide, achieving just judicial processes and improving 
prison conditions is imperative. 
•	
Governments globally are struggling to restore pre-COVID-19 budget 
reliability. New international pressures affecting economies have 
increased budget expenditures beyond initial approvals. 
•	
All SDGs depend on establishing lasting peace and preventing violent 
conflicts. Urgent action is needed to combat corruption and organized 
crime, strengthen the rule of law and access to justice, build effective and 
inclusive governance institutions, and protect rights and fundamental 
freedoms. 
Civilian deaths in armed conflict saw the steepest rise since 2015
In 2023, civilian casualties in armed conflicts surged by a staggering 72 per 
cent, the steepest rise since 2015. Despite fewer civilian deaths in some 
conflict zones, others witnessed significant increases, with 7 in 10 recorded 
deaths occurring in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory in 2023. 
For the second consecutive year, the number of civilians killed in conflict 
rose dramatically, reversing a downward trend from 2016 to 2019. By 
2023, civilian casualties had soared to over 33,400, nearing the 2015 peak. 
Additionally, the number of women killed in conflict increased for the first 
time since 2015. In 2022, 2 in 10 civilians killed in conflicts were women; 1 
in 10 were children. By 2023, 4 in 10 were women and 3 in 10 were children. 
These alarming figures indicate that the road to global peace and security, 
essential for sustainable development, has been diverted. The trend must be 
reversed, conflicts must end, and parties to conflicts must strictly abide by 
international humanitarian and human rights obligations to protect civilians’ 
lives.

Slow progress in reducing homicides continues even as the world has moved past a 2021 spike in rates
The global homicide rate gradually decreased from 5.9 victims per 100,000 
population in 2015 to 5.5 in 2020. This downward trend was disrupted in 
2021, when the rate sharply rose to 5.8 before slightly retreating to 5.6 in 
2022. The global homicide rate declined by 5 per cent between 2015 and 
2022. If this pattern persists, the rate is projected to be 5.1 per 100,000 
population by 2030, an overall decrease of just 13 per cent since 2015. The 
two regions with the highest rates are Latin America and the Caribbean, 
which is plagued by organized crime and gang activities, and Africa, which 
has a large youth population, increased incidences of extreme heat and 
persistent inequality. In 2022, 88,000 women became homicide victims 
globally compared to 360,000 men.
Note: Projections for the years 2023–2030 represent linear extrapolations of trends observed

The experience of bribery differs by national income level  
About 19 per cent of people reported being asked to pay or having paid 
a bribe to a public official in the last 12 months, based on 138 countries 
with available data from 2015 to 2022. Notable regional variations were 
apparent. In Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa, an average of 29.7 per cent 
and 26.6 per cent of the population, respectively, experienced bribery in the 
last 12 months, compared to 10.1 per cent in Europe and Northern America. 
The prevalence of bribery varied by national income level, ranging from 
an average of 9 per cent in high-income countries to 32 per cent in low-
income countries. Data from 18 countries from 2010 to 2021 suggested that 
men were more likely than women to engage in bribery, often influenced 
by differing interactions with male-dominated sectors like the police or 
customs.
Half of countries have overcrowded prisons, sparking concerns about health and human rights
The global prison population rose from 11.1 million in 2015 to 11.5 million in 
2022, a growth rate slower than that of the world population as a whole. 
Consequently, the prisoner-to-population rate decreased from 150 prisoners 
per 100,000 population in 2015 to 144 per 100,000 in 2022. Central and 
Southern Asia had the lowest rates at 54 per 100,000, while Latin America 
and the Caribbean had the highest at 277 per 100,000. 
Access to justice is a fundamental human right. In 2022, however, nearly 
a third (3.5 million) of the global prison population was held in pretrial 
detention, a share that remained stable between 2015 and 2022. While 
most regions showed some improvements, Central and Southern Asia saw 
a worrying rise; almost 60 per cent of prisoners was held unsentenced. 
Overcrowding in prisons operating at over 100 per cent of intended capacity 
was a concern in half of countries with data. This issue was particularly 
severe in Latin America and the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa, where 
over three quarters of countries reported overcrowding. Globally, one in five 
countries operates prisons at over 150 per cent of intended capacity, with 
documented harm to health and higher rates of mortality.

Killings of human rights defenders decreased but remain high, and more journalists died in conflict 
zones 
In 2023, 320 human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists in 40 
countries were killed, down from 448 cases in 36 countries in 2022, based 
on cases recorded by national human rights institutions and the United 
Nations. Conflict zones saw a sharp increase in the killings of journalists and 
media workers, with 40 lives lost, reversing a downward trend since 2017. 
Latin America and the Caribbean remained the deadliest region, accounting 
for 70 per cent of all killings. Enforced disappearances globally nearly 
doubled for the second consecutive year, with at least 54 cases reported in 
14 countries in 2023.
Nearly a decade since Member States committed to zero killings and attacks 
against defenders of rights and freedom of speech, incidents have been 
observed in at least 97 countries. The total number of annual killings has 
not fallen below 300 since 2015, with peaks in 2018 and 2022. Kidnapping, 
detention, legal harassment and online attacks are other major threats. 
Strong protection frameworks are needed to stem this trend, particularly in 
countries where violent conflict or social unrest erupts or escalates. 
Multiple crises affect government budget reliability
Governments across the world have found it difficult to return to pre-
COVID-19 levels of budget reliability, in part due to new international 
challenges impacting economies, including global political instability, 
inflation and volatile resource prices. Attempts to support economic activity 
and address social stresses have resulted in higher budget expenditure 
than originally approved across all regions. Budget reliability improved 
in 2021 and 2022 compared to 2020 but remained weaker than pre-
pandemic levels. Northern Africa and Western Asia, Central and Southern 
Asia, and Europe and Northern America experienced the highest spending 
deviations relative to the pre-pandemic period, likely due to factors such as 
geopolitical tensions, inflation and higher-than-expected revenues. Multiple 
crises emphasize the need for governments to better prepare for future 
emergencies.

•	
Developing countries face a $4 trillion annual investment gap to achieve 
the SDGs. Foreign direct investment flows to developing countries have 
decreased while gains in remittances and ODA have been modest. The 
Secretary-General has urged countries to support an SDG Stimulus of at 
least $500 billion annually.
•	
External debt stock levels have remained unprecedentedly high in 
developing countries. About 60 per cent of low-income countries are at 
high risk of debt distress or already experiencing it. 
•	
Approximately 67 per cent of the world’s population was online in 2023, 
up 69 per cent from 2015. Investment in infrastructure and affordable 
Internet access for the remaining 2.6 billion people is crucial for inclusive 
development.
•	
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of high-quality, 
timely and disaggregated data for informed decision-making. Yet 
funding gaps threaten the resilience of statistical systems in developing 
countries. 
•	
	In a landscape of declining international cooperation and rising 
geopolitical tensions, strengthened global partnerships and enhanced 
cooperation are urgently needed to address widening financing 
gaps, reinforce post-pandemic recovery and promote sustainable 
development, particularly in the LDCs and other vulnerable countries.
The trillions needed to achieve the SDGs require world leaders to rapidly scale up investments
 Mobilizing financial resources is crucial for driving global recovery and 
achieving the SDGs. In 2023, the annual SDG investment gap in developing 
countries was estimated at about $4 trillion, with over half, or $2.2 trillion, 
needed for the energy transition alone. The current investment gap is 60 per 
cent higher than the $2.5 trillion estimated in 2019. The increase results from 
shortfalls since 2015, compounded by multiple global challenges, including 
the pandemic and the food, fuel and financing crises. 
In 2023, ODA from Development Assistance Committee members totalled 
$223.7 billion, representing 0.37 per cent of members’ combined gross 
national income. This marked a 1.8 per cent increase in real terms from 
2022 and a 47 per cent rise from 2015, making it the fifth consecutive year 
of record-high ODA. The increase was primarily driven by aid for Ukraine, 
humanitarian assistance and contributions to international organizations. 
Net bilateral ODA flows to Africa increased by 2 per cent and to LDCs by 
3 per cent. 
Global foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in 2023 amounted to $1.33 
trillion, a decrease of 2 per cent from 2022. Excluding a few European 
conduit economies that registered large swings in investment flows, global 
FDI flows were 10 per cent lower than in 2022. FDI flows to developing 
countries fell by 7 per cent to $867 billion and declined or stagnated in
most regions.
Remittances have proven resilient. They have become the premier source 
of external finance for developing countries in the post-COVID-19 period. 
In 2023, remittances to low- and middle-income countries reached an 
estimated $669 billion, reflecting a normalization of flows following the post-
pandemic robust growth. The United States remained the largest source 
of remittances in the world, followed by Saudi Arabia and Switzerland. The 
global average cost of sending a $200 remittance was 6.4 per cent in 2023, 
more than twice the SDG target of 3 per cent. Development impacts of 
remittances can be augmented by reducing remittance costs and worker-
paid recruitment costs.
In 2022, additional financial resources for developing countries from multiple 
sources, reported by 101 bilateral and multilateral providers to measure 
total official support for sustainable development (TOSSD), amounted to 
$342.1 billion. This included $276.6 billion in official resources, $55.3 billion 
from private finance and $10.2 billion from private grants for development. 
Sustainable development grants (both official and private) decreased from 
$129.2 billion in 2021 to $127.5 billion in 2022. Sustainable concessional 
development loans increased by 6 per cent from $54.8 billion in 2021 to 
$58.0 billion in 2022, while non-concessional loans decreased from 106.9 
billion in 2021 to $101.3 billion in 2022. Mobilized private finance increased 
by 21 per cent from 2021. 
At the SDG Summit in September 2023, Heads of State and Government 
committed to advancing the Secretary-General’s SDG Stimulus proposal of 
unlocking $500 billion in additional financing and investment annually.

Rising borrowing costs put developing countries at risk of debt crises
In 2022, the external debt stock of low- and middle-income countries fell for 
the first time since 2015, dropping to $9.0 trillion from $9.3 trillion in 2021. 
Even so, external debt stock levels remained unprecedentedly high after 
more than a decade of rapid debt accumulation. In 2022, the external debt 
stock of countries eligible to borrow from the International Development 
Association (IDA) – which supports the poorest countries in boosting 
economic development – increased by 2.7 per cent, reaching a record high 
of $1.1 trillion. Public and publicly guaranteed debt service payments by 
low- and middle-income countries hit a record $444 billion and are forecast 
to continue growing. Interest payments on total external debt stock by 
IDA-eligible countries have doubled since 2015 to $23.6 billion and are 
expected to rise further as global interest rates trend upward. About 60 
per cent of low-income countries are at high risk of debt distress or already 
experiencing it. Increasing borrowing costs have and will continue to divert 
scarce resources from critical development needs such as poverty reduction, 
climate action, health and education.

COVID-19 impacted global data collection for the SDGs, highlighting the need for increased investment 
in statistical systems 
High-quality, timely and disaggregated data are crucial for guiding decision-
making on all SDGs. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly hindered the 
ability of national statistical offices to collect recent data. This has led to a 
small decline in the average Open Data Inventory (ODIN) coverage scores 
from 2020 to 2022, mainly in low- and middle-income countries. Even in 
the most resource-rich countries, the average ODIN data coverage score 
remains below 60 out of 100, highlighting the urgent need for increased 
investment in data infrastructure and production. Despite these gaps, the 
long-term trajectory of data coverage score tracks upward.
Based on the Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI), global scores on the 
Data Sources Performance Index and Data Infrastructure Performance Index 
improved between 2016 and 2023. Data sources gained only 3 points, held 
back in part by COVID-19 disruptions, while data infrastructure, both the 
hard and soft infrastructure to produce data, increased by around 14 points.
In 2023, 159 countries and territories reported having statistical legislation 
compliant with the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics, up from 132 
in 2019, indicating significant progress in modernizing national statistical 
systems. Additionally, 163 countries implemented national statistical plans, 
up from 143 in 2019, with 109 fully funded. International support for data and 
statistics development has increased, reaching $799 million in 2021, 14 per 
cent above 2020 and 44 per cent above 2015. Funding gaps remain a major 
issue, particularly in Africa and the LDCs, where only a fraction of plans is 
fully funded. This resource insufficiency threatens the resilience of statistical 
systems and risks leaving vulnerable populations behind. Addressing these 
challenges requires more funding, mainstreamed data activities and strategic 
planning aligned with emerging development priorities.
Globally, one in three people are still offline, underscoring the urgency of infrastructure investments 
and affordable Internet access, particularly in underdeveloped regions 
Approximately 67 per cent of the world’s population, or 5.4 billion people, 
was online in 2023, 4.7 per cent more than in 2022 and 69 per cent more 
than in 2015. Internet use continues to correlate with regional development. 
Australia and New Zealand and Europe and Northern America have 
achieved universal usage (above 95 per cent), while only 37 and 38 per 
cent of people in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania (excluding Australia and 
New Zealand), respectively, are online. Although the COVID-19 pandemic 
temporarily accelerated Internet adoption, recent growth rates have reverted 
to pre-pandemic levels. Worldwide, 70 per cent of men use the Internet 
compared to 65 per cent of women, with 244 million more men than women 
online in 2023. Fixed broadband subscriptions grew at an annual rate of 
6.4 per cent between 2015 and 2023, reaching 19 subscriptions per 100 
inhabitants globally. These connections are scarce in low-income countries, 
however, due to high costs and inadequate infrastructure. Investments 
in infrastructure and affordable Internet access are crucial, especially in 
underserved regions.

No poverty
•	
The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shocks from 2020 to 2022 
have hampered global efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. The global 
extreme poverty rate increased in 2020 for the first time in decades, 
setting back progress by three years. Since then, recovery has been 
uneven, with low-income countries lagging behind. By 2030, 590 million 
people may still live in extreme poverty if current trends persist. Without 
a substantial acceleration in poverty reduction, fewer than 3 in 10 
countries are expected to halve national poverty by 2030.
•	
	Despite increasing efforts and commitments to expand social protection 
programmes, significant coverage gaps left 1.4 billion children uncovered 
in 2023. 
•	
	Climate change is hindering poverty reduction, and disasters result in 
millions of households becoming poor or remaining trapped in poverty. 
•	
Ending poverty requires a wide-ranging approach that combines 
comprehensive social protection systems, inclusive economic policies, 
investments in human capital, measures to address inequality and 
climate resilience, and international cooperation and partnership. 
Extreme poverty rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels except in low-income countries
The COVID-19 pandemic caused extreme poverty to rise in 2020 for the first 
time in decades, reversing global progress by three years. The share of the 
world’s population living in extreme poverty rose from 8.9 per cent in 2019 
to 9.7 per cent in 2020, driven by increases in low- and lower-middle-income 
countries. In contrast, extreme poverty continue to decline in upper-middle- 
and high-income countries, attributed to swift fiscal support for vulnerable 
groups. By 2022, extreme poverty had returned to pre-pandemic levels in 
most countries, except low-income ones. In 2022, 712 million people (or 
9 per cent of the world’s population) lived in extreme poverty, an increase of 
23 million people over 2019. Projections suggest that by 2030, 590 million 
people, or 6.9 per cent of the global population, may remain in extreme 
poverty if current trends persist. 
In the 75 most vulnerable countries, which qualify for concessional lending 
from the World Bank’s International Development Association, one in four 
people live on less than $2.15 a day – more than eight times the extreme 
poverty rate in the rest of the world. One in three of these countries are now 
poorer on average than before the pandemic. 
Traders transport charcoal to the market in Madagascar, among the 
countries with the world’s highest poverty rates.
Working poverty has declined but still afflicts 241 million workers 
The global working poverty rate slightly increased to 7.7 per cent in 2020 
before declining to 6.9 per cent in 2023. This indicates a consistent 
downward trend in working poverty worldwide since 2015. Despite progress, 
nearly 241 million workers globally still lived in extreme poverty in 2023. 
Little positive change is expected in 2024. 
There are wide regional disparities amid the overall positive global trend. 
Despite a falling working poverty rate, more than half of workers living in 
extreme poverty were still in sub-Saharan Africa (145 million). Central and 
Southern Asia notably reduced working poverty by 6.9 percentage points 
between 2015 and 2023. Conversely, Northern Africa and Western Asia saw 
an increase in the rate from 2.5 per cent in 2015 to 6.2 per cent in 2023. 
Working poverty disproportionately affects some groups. Globally, youth 
are twice as likely as adults to be in working poverty. Women typically 
experience higher working poverty rates than men, with the most 
pronounced gender gap observed in the least developed countries (LDCs).

Despite improvement, 7 in 10 children worldwide still lack social protection coverage 
In 2023, only 28.2 per cent of children aged 0 to 15 globally received child 
cash benefits, up from 22.1 per cent in 2015. This left 1.4 billion children 
without social protection coverage. Significant regional variations were 
evident, and despite a near doubling of coverage from 4.5 per cent in 2015 
to 8.7 per cent in 2023, low-income countries were still far from universal 
coverage. During the same period, lower-middle-income and upper-middle- 
income countries raised coverage from 15.0 to 23.5 per cent and from 21.8 to 
27.8 per cent, respectively. High-income countries maintained a continued 
progression towards universal coverage, with rates rising from 76.8 to 
80.5 per cent. 
Achieving universal coverage will require closing a major financing gap. 
To guarantee at least basic social security for all children, upper- and lower-
middle-income countries would need to invest an additional $98.1 billion and 
$88.8 billion, respectively. Low-income countries would require an additional 
$59.6 billion.
Goal 1 | No poverty
Efforts to reduce disaster impacts and risks have not yet stemmed billions in economic losses 
Despite significant efforts to reduce disaster impacts, related economic 
losses remain stubbornly high. From 2015 to 2022, average annual direct 
economic losses exceeded $115 billion worldwide, an amount equivalent to 
0.3 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) of reporting countries. 
LDCs and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) suffer disproportionately 
from disasters. Disaster-related economic losses in LDCs are over six times 
the global average. From 2015 to 2022, this group of countries accounted 
for 6.9 per cent of global reported economic losses from disasters despite 
comprising only 1.1 per cent of reporting countries’ combined GDP. Similarly, 
LLDCs reported 4.9 per cent of total economic losses, four times the 
global average, while accounting for only 1.1 per cent of reporting countries’ 
combined GDP. 
Government spending on essential services is ticking up but with a chronic gap between advanced and 
developing economies 
Based on recent data from about 100 countries, worldwide government 
spending on essential services – encompassing education, health and social 
protection – averages around 50 per cent of total government expenditure. 
Among advanced economies, this figure rises to 60 per cent, while in 
emerging market and developing economies, it stands at 40 per cent. Over 
the past two decades, both groups have seen a slight uptick in their shares, 
maintaining a consistent 20-percentage-point gap between them.
On the components of essential services, advanced economies notably 
outpace emerging market and developing economies in social protection 
spending by roughly 15 percentage points on average, largely due to broader 
pension coverage. Health spending accounts for about 5 percentage 
points of this difference. The pandemic temporarily skewed these trends, 
with increased spending on social protection and health and a decline in 
education expenditure due to school closures. While these measures are 
expected to be short-lived, prolonged health issues and educational losses 
among individuals could potentially have long-term impacts on human 
capital.

Zero hunger
•	
After rising sharply in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, global 
hunger and food insecurity remained persistently high and almost 
unchanged for three years. In 2023, about 733 million people faced 
hunger, and 2.33 billion people experienced moderate to severe food 
insecurity. Despite progress, 148 million children under age 5 suffered 
from stunting in 2022. If current trends persist, one in five children under 
age 5 will be affected by stunting in 2030.
•	
	In 2022, almost 60 per cent of countries worldwide faced moderately to 
abnormally high food prices due to the spillover effects of conflicts, such 
as disrupted supply chains. 
•	
	Achieving zero hunger requires intensified efforts to transform food 
systems so they are sustainable, resilient and equitable. Moreover, 
accelerating improvements in diets, nutrition, health and hygiene is 
crucial to meeting the target of halving the number of children suffering 
from chronic undernutrition.
Hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition remain prevalent, calling for intensified efforts
After rising sharply from 2019 to 2021, global hunger, measured by the 
prevalence of undernourishment, persisted at nearly the same level for 
three years, affecting 9.1 per cent of the population in 2023 compared with 
7.5 per cent in 2019. Between 713 and 757 million people faced hunger in 
2023 – one in 11 people globally, and one in five in Africa. Moreover, an 
estimated 28.9 per cent of the world’s population, or 2.33 billion people, 
were moderately or severely food insecure in 2023 – 383 million more than 
in 2019. 
Malnutrition among children under age 5 remains a significant concern, 
posing heightened risks to their growth and development. Globally in 2022, 
an estimated 22.3 per cent of children under age 5, or 148 million, were 
affected by stunting (being too short for their age), down from 24.6 per cent
in 2015. Based on current trends, one out of five (19.5 per cent) of children 
under age 5 will be affected by stunting in 2030. Some 37 million children 
(5.6 per cent) were overweight, while 45 million (6.8 per cent) experienced 
wasting, above the global target of 3 per cent by 2030. Three quarters of 
children under age 5 with stunting lived in Central and Southern Asia 
(36.7 per cent) and sub-Saharan Africa (38.3 per cent). More than half of 
those affected by wasting lived in Central and Southern Asia (56.2 per cent) 
and almost one quarter in sub-Saharan Africa (22.9 per cent). 
To achieve Goal 2, significant efforts are needed to mitigate the impacts 
of climate change, conflict and economic crisis. Record-high food prices in 
2022 worsened purchasing power and access to food, negatively impacting 
food security and nutritional outcomes. Increased global public expenditure 
on agriculture was at least one positive trend.

Accelerated action could bring productive and sustainable agriculture within reach globally 
Productive and sustainable agriculture is key to ensuring the attainment and 
continued satisfaction of human needs in present and future generations. To 
assess global progress in sustainable agriculture, the Inter-agency and Expert 
Group on SDG Indicators adopted a new set of seven subindicators covering 
economic, social and environmental dimensions. Data from 2021 suggested 
that the world was at a moderate distance from achieving productive and 
sustainable agriculture (with a score of 3.4 out of 5) and had witnessed a 
slight improvement since 2015. Regional disparities were evident, however, 
with the highest score of 4.1 in Europe and Northern America compared to 
the lowest score of 2.6 in the LDCs. While more detailed analysis is required 
to investigate the root causes of varying rates of progress, evidence suggests 
that all regions urgently need to take sustained, concerted actions to improve 
productive and sustainable agriculture by 2030. They otherwise risk missing 
the target by a wide margin.

Small-scale food producers are vital in fighting hunger but earn less than half the income of larger-scale 
operations
Small-scale food producers play essential roles in agricultural and food 
production systems, enhancing resilience and fighting hunger. Despite 
their significant contributions, however, they are often among the most 
vulnerable groups in rural areas and within the broader agrifood system. 
In 95 per cent of countries with available data, the average annual income 
of small-scale producers is less than half that of larger-scale producers. 
This income disparity persists across countries, regardless of income 
level. Small-scale food producers headed by men typically generate higher 
incomes than those headed by women. The latter had incomes that were 
less than 70 per cent of those earned by the former in nearly 50 per cent of 
countries with available data.
Goal 2 | Zero hunger
Nearly 60 per cent of countries faced moderately to abnormally high food prices in 2022
Globally, the proportion of countries facing moderately to abnormally 
high food prices rose sharply in 2022, reaching a new record high of 58.1 
per cent. This represented a nearly fourfold increase from the 2015–2019 
average level of 15.2 per cent. In Central and Southern Asia and Eastern 
and South-Eastern Asia, the share of countries facing moderately to 
abnormally high food prices in 2022 was lower than the peak in 2020 but 
remained higher than the yearly average and the 2015–2019 average. The 
share steadily increased in sub-Saharan Africa between 2020 and 2022. 
Major disruptions to logistics and food supply chains after war broke out 
in Ukraine resulted in higher food and energy prices, particularly during the 
first half of 2022. The war also exerted strong upward pressure on fertilizer 
prices, adding uncertainty to farmer planting decisions.

Global government spending and aid for agriculture surge amid economic challenges 
Government spending reflects national priorities and can directly respond 
to economic and social challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural 
disasters or inflation. Between 2015 and 2022, global government spending 
on agriculture increased steadily, reaching a record high of $749 billion in 
2022. Government expenditure on agriculture relative to the sector’s GDP 
contribution, as measured by the agriculture orientation index, declined 
from 0.5 in 2015 to 0.43 in 2021 before rebounding to 0.48 in 2022. The 
pandemic contributed to the fall as government resources were allocated to 
other sectors. 
From 2015 to 2022, the volume of aid for agriculture provided to developing 
countries increased by 47.2 per cent, from $12.3 billion to $18.1 billion 
(in constant 2022 prices). A 33 per cent increase from 2021 to 2022 was 
primarily driven by agricultural development projects and initiatives in 
agricultural policy, administrative management and financial services. 
Notably, Africa accounted for 65 per cent of the increase in 2022, mainly 
due to non-concessional loans for agricultural development projects from 
the Islamic Development Bank in Egypt.

Good health 
and well-being
•	
The COVID-19 pandemic has ravaged global health, undoing nearly 10 
years of progress in life expectancy. While most health-related indicators 
are moving in the right direction globally, current trends are insufficient 
to meet targets set for 2030.
•	
The maternal mortality ratio is largely stuck at a level more than three 
times the 2030 target. Under-5 deaths reached an historic low in 2022, 
but progress has slowed. Without accelerated declines, 35 million 
children will not live to see their fifth birthday by 2030. 
•	
The global response to infectious diseases has saved millions of lives 
and paved the way for healthier communities. Inequalities and emerging 
threats jeopardize these accomplishments, however, underscoring the 
need for sustained efforts and innovative strategies.
•	
	More than half the world’s population is not covered by essential health 
services, while an ageing health workforce must now meet growing 
demands from an ageing population. Ensuring universal health coverage 
without financial hardship is crucial to healthy lives and well-being for all. 
•	
The world is not on track to achieve Goal 3. Changing course requires 
prioritizing the achievement of universal health coverage, strengthening 
health systems, investing in disease prevention and treatment, and 
addressing disparities in access to care and services, especially for 
vulnerable populations.
The COVID-19 pandemic turned back progress 
in life expectancy and gains in combating 
communicable diseases 
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected global health, reversing 
steady progress in life expectancy over the past two decades. Prior to the 
pandemic, global life expectancy rose consistently, from 66.8 years in 
2000 to 73.1 years in 2019, reflecting years of improvements in health and 
related areas. COVID-19 swiftly reversed this positive trend, with global life 
expectancy plummeting to 71.4 years by 2021, back to the level of 2012.  
Before the pandemic, non-communicable diseases had been steadily 
increasing as the leading cause of death, accounting for 59.5 per cent of 
all deaths in 2000 and 73.9 per cent in 2019. The share of communicable 
diseases dropped from 32.2 per cent in 2000 to 18.2 per cent in 2019. As 
COVID-19 emerged as a new infectious disease and started to take a toll 
on human lives, the share of deaths due to communicable diseases jumped 
back to the 2005 level (28.1 per cent) in 2021, while the share of deaths 
due to non-communicable diseases decreased to 65.3 per cent. COVID-19 
ranked among the top three leading causes of death globally in 2020 and 
2021, with striking regional variations.

nationwide polio campaign in Malawi.
Progress towards universal health coverage has 
slowed, leaving billions without care and subject 
to catastrophic costs  
Essential health service coverage is measured using an index, reported on a 
score of 0 to 100, based on 14 indicators across four domains: reproductive, 
maternal, newborn and child health; infectious diseases; non-communicable 
diseases; and service capacity and access. The global score on the index 
increased remarkably from 45 in 2000 to 65 in 2015. Progress slowed 
thereafter, however, reaching a score of only 68 in 2021. The proportion of 
the population lacking essential health services fell by approximately 15 per 
cent between 2000 and 2021. Yet minimal progress after 2015 left about 
4.5 billion people without coverage in 2021, especially in rural and poorer 
populations. 
Financial hardship due to out-of-pocket health spending has worsened since 
2015, affecting 2 billion people in 2019. They included 1 billion people facing 
catastrophic health expenditures exceeding 10 per cent of their household 
budget and 344 million driven deeper into extreme poverty by health costs. 
The proportion of the population with catastrophic expenditures increased 
from 12.6 per cent in 2015 to 13.5 per cent in 2019.
An ageing health workforce struggles to meet rising demands from an ageing population 
Progressing towards universal health coverage requires addressing the 
global shortage of health workers. Yet data from 2015 to 2022 reveal stark 
disparities, with low-income countries experiencing the lowest health worker 
density and distribution. Per 10,000 people, these countries had medians of 
only 1.1 medical doctors, 7.5 nursing and midwifery personnel, 0.04 dentists 
and 0.2 pharmacists, compared with medians in high-income countries of 
35.6 medical doctors, 76.8 nursing and midwifery personnel, 7.0 dentists and 
8.8 pharmacists. 
Health systems are experiencing increased strains in catering to the 
mounting health needs of an ageing global population, more so because the 
health workforce itself is ageing. An estimated 1.8 million additional health 
workers are needed in 54 countries, primarily high-income ones, to replace 
retiring health professionals and maintain the current age-standardized 
density of health workers.
Note: A health workforce is considered “ageing” when the share of health workers aged 55 years 
and above exceeds that of health workers aged 35 years and below.

Declines in maternal mortality have stalled, with wide disparities by region and income 
Between 2015 and 2020, the global maternal mortality ratio declined only 
marginally from 227 to 223 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, over 
three times higher than the 2030 target of 70. Sub-Saharan Africa and 
Southern Asia account for 87 per cent of maternal deaths. In 2020, the 
maternal mortality ratio in low-income countries was 430 maternal deaths 
per 100,000 live births compared to 13 in high-income nations. The average 
maternal mortality ratio for very high and high alert fragile states was 551 
in 2020, more than twice the global average. Achieving the 2030 target 
requires an annual reduction rate of 11.6 per cent between 2021 and 2030.
Skilled birth attendance has improved globally, rising from 80 per cent of 
births in 2015 to 86 per cent in 2023. Improved care quality could save 
the lives of up to 1 million newborns and 150,000 mothers annually. Yet 
progress is stalling; 18 million births occurred without skilled assistance in 
2023. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 73 per cent of births were attended by 
skilled personnel in 2023, the lowest rate worldwide. In contrast, Eastern and 
South-Eastern Asia achieved a rate of 96 per cent.
Goal 3 | Good health and well-being
Improvements in adolescent birth rates and access to modern contraceptives do not benefit all women 
and girls equally   
The adolescent birth rate for women aged 15–19 years declined to 41.3 births 
per 1,000 women in 2023, from 47.2 in 2015 and 64.5 in 2000. For girls 
aged 10–14 years, the rate fell from 3.3 births per 1,000 girls in 2000 to 1.8 
in 2015 and 1.5 in 2023. Yet 13.1 million babies, approximately 10 per cent of 
the total number of births, were born to adolescent mothers in 2023. Central 
and Southern Asia witnessed the largest drop-offs in adolescent birth rates 
between 2000 and 2023, with a 72 per cent reduction in the 15–19 age 
group and a 90 per cent decrease in the 10–14 cohort. Sub-Saharan Africa 
continued to have the highest rates globally, at 97.9 births per 1,000 women 
aged 15–19 and 4.4 per 1,000 girls aged 10–14 in 2023.  
The proportion of women of reproductive age (15–49 years) who have 
their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods has climbed 
from 76.5 per cent in 2015 to 77.6 per cent in 2024, corresponding to an 
additional 75 million women using modern contraceptive methods globally. 
By 2030, this proportion is projected to reach 78.2 per cent, a net increase 
of 45 million women. This marks a fair improvement but still falls far short of 
universal access.
Under-5 deaths hit a record low in 2022; achieving the SDG target could save 9 million lives by 2030 
Global under-5 deaths reached a historic low of 4.9 million in 2022, down 
from 9.9 million in 2000 and 6.0 million in 2015. Nearly half these deaths 
(2.3 million) occurred during the neonatal period (the first 28 days of life). 
The under-5 mortality rate was 37 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2022, a 
51 per cent reduction since 2000 and a 14 per cent reduction from 2015. The 
global neonatal mortality rate fell to 17 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2022, a 
44 per cent reduction since 2000 and a 12 per cent reduction since 2015. 
Unfortunately, the annual rate of reduction in under-5 mortality contracted 
from 3.8 per cent in 2000–2015 to 2.1 per cent in 2015–2022. The neonatal 
mortality rate followed a similar pattern, declining from 3.0 per cent to
 1.8 per cent. If current trends continue, an estimated 35 million children will 
die before reaching their fifth birthday by 2030. If all countries met the target 
for under-5 mortality, an estimated 9 million lives could be saved by 2030. 
As of 2022, 134 countries had already met the target. Seven more were on 
track but 59 countries, nearly three quarters of which are in sub-Saharan 
Africa, will need faster progress to meet the target.

Efforts to combat communicable diseases have prevented millions of deaths but are threatened by 
inequalities and emerging threats  
HIV/AIDS: The world has made significant strides in combating HIV. 
In 2022, an estimated 1.3 million new infections represented a 27 per 
cent decrease since 2015 and a 38 per cent reduction since 2010. Sub-
Saharan Africa, the region most affected by HIV, has more than halved 
new infections annually since 2010. In 2022, 29.8 million of the 39 million 
people living with HIV were receiving life-saving treatment. Increased 
access to treatment has averted 20.8 million AIDS-related deaths in the 
past three decades. In addition, the integration of HIV testing and treatment 
with maternal and childcare services has prevented over 3.4 million HIV 
infections in children since 2000. Stronger linking of services for HIV and 
tuberculosis has averted an estimated 6.4 million tuberculosis-related 
deaths among people living with HIV from 2010 to 2022.
Not everyone is benefiting equally from these advancements, however. 
In 2022, 43 per cent of the 1.5 million children living with HIV were not 
receiving treatment. Every week, 4,000 adolescent girls and young women 
acquired HIV; 3,100 lived in sub-Saharan Africa. Almost a quarter of new 
HIV infections were in Asia in 2022. Steep increases of new HIV infections 
have continued in Northern Africa and Western Asia. These worrying 
trends are primarily due to a lack of preventive services for people from 
marginalized and key populations, punitive laws, violence, social stigma and 
discrimination.
Tuberculosis: The reported number of people newly diagnosed with 
tuberculosis reached 7.5 million in 2022, the highest figure since global 
monitoring began in 1995 and above the previous historical peak of 
7.1 million in 2019. Worldwide, an estimated 10.6 million people developed 
tuberculosis in 2022, up from 10.3 million in 2021 and 10.0 million in 
2020. The disease remains the world’s second leading cause of death from 
a single infectious agent, with an estimated 1.3 million deaths in 2022. 
This was down from the estimated 1.4 million deaths in both 2020 and 
2021 and almost back to pre-pandemic levels. The global net decrease 
in tuberculosis-related deaths between 2015 and 2022, however, was 
19 per cent, well below the target of a 75 per cent reduction by 2025. 
The estimated disease incidence rate was 133 new cases per 100,000 
population in 2022, a fall of 8.7 per cent since 2015. A return to the pre-
pandemic downward trend may occur in 2023 or 2024.
Malaria: An estimated 249 million malaria cases occurred globally in 2022, 
16 million more than in 2019 before the pandemic. The disease claimed an 
estimated 608,000 lives in 2022, an increase of 32,000 compared to 2019. 
Since 2015, insecticide-treated net use among young children and pregnant 
women in sub-Saharan Africa has stagnated at around 56 per cent. In 2022, 
an estimated 58 per cent of at-risk pregnant women did not receive the 
recommended preventive malaria therapy, and about one third of children 
with fever did not receive care from a health provider. Alongside disruptions 
caused by COVID-19, the global malaria response faces increasing threats, 
including drug and insecticide resistance, humanitarian crises, funding 
constraints, delays in programme implementation and climate change 
impacts. Despite these challenges, some important achievements sustain 
progress towards elimination in many countries with a low malaria burden, 
with 25 countries reporting fewer than 10 cases in 2022. Thirteen countries 
have been certified malaria-free since 2015.
Neglected tropical diseases: In 2022, 1.6 billion people required treatment 
and care for neglected tropical diseases, a 26.1 per cent decline from 2010. 
The proportion of the population living in LDCs who required interventions 
for these diseases decreased from 79 per cent to 45 per cent during this 
period. As of December 2023, 50 countries, territories and areas had 
eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease, demonstrating the 
power of comprehensive interventions combining mass and individual 
treatment, vector control, veterinary public health and provision of safe 
water and sanitation.
Progress has not been fast enough to meet the target of reducing the global 
population requiring interventions for neglected tropical diseases by 
90 per cent between 2010 and 2030. Achieving this target demands 
a renewed effort to scale up interventions, particularly in high-burden 
countries, many of which are LDCs.

Goal 3 | Good health and well-being
Twenty-one million children missed out on life-
saving vaccines in 2022  
Between 2000 and 2019, the proportion of children receiving three doses of 
the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) vaccine rose from 72 to 86 per 
cent, then dipped to 81 per cent in 2021 before rebounding to 84 per cent in 
2022. In 2022, 20.5 million children missed at least one routine vaccine and 
14.3 million received no vaccines at all. Coverage of two doses of the measles 
vaccine and three doses of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine increased 
in 2022, reaching 74 per cent and 60 per cent, respectively, following 
stagnation in 2020–2021. Global coverage of the human papillomavirus 
(HPV) vaccine, critical for women’s and girls’ health, stood at only 
15 per cent in 2022, despite 130 countries introducing it in their national 
immunization services by the end of the year. 
Treatment reaches only marginal shares of people 
with drug and alcohol disorders 
Newly available estimates reveal that globally, only about 1 in 11 individuals 
with drug use disorders received related treatment in 2022. Coverage 
decreased from 11 per cent to under 9 per cent between 2015 and 2022, 
and has notably decelerated in the Americas and Asia. Treatment coverage 
for women consistently lags behind that for men across all regions, with 
over 13 per cent of men receiving treatment compared to less than 6 per 
cent of women in 2022. Data on access to treatment for those with alcohol 
use disorders indicate a dire situation, with coverage ranging from 0.3 per 
cent to a maximum of 14 per cent in reporting countries. Considering that 
approximately 283 million people or 5 per cent of the adult population lives 
with alcohol use disorders, hundreds of millions are going without needed 
treatment and care. 
More than 9 in 10 deaths caused by air pollution occur in lower- and middle-income countries
Particulate air pollution caused approximately 104 deaths per 100,000 
people annually by 2019, despite a slight decrease in the global mortality 
rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution since 2010. Ninety-
three per cent of the burden fell on low- and middle-income countries in 
2019, primarily in Asia and Africa. Non-communicable diseases accounted 
for 85 per cent of air pollution-related deaths, while acute lower respiratory 
infections made up the remaining 15 per cent. Concerningly, 31 per cent of 
deaths from acute lower respiratory infections occurred in children under 
age 5.
Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand), sub-Saharan Africa and 
most of Asia have the highest mortality rates attributable to air pollution. 
This is largely due to significant exposure to air pollution in households, 
a large proportion of which rely on polluting fuels and technologies for 
cooking, lighting and heating. Health risks from household air pollution are 
particularly high among women and children, who tend to spend more time 
in and around cooking stoves.

Official development assistance for health has scaled up but with a major share spent on COVID-19 
Total net official development assistance (ODA) for medical research and 
basic health sectors has significantly increased in recent years, primarily 
driven by the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ODA for basic 
health care from all donors more than doubled in real terms between 
2015 and 2022, rising from $10.5 billion to $21.1 billion (in constant 2022 
prices). It rose 4.4 per cent in 2022 compared to 2021. In 2022, COVID-19 
control constituted the largest share of ODA for basic health care at 42 per 
cent, totalling $8.8 billion, of which $1.6 billion was for COVID-19 vaccine 
donations. Between 2020 and 2022, COVID-19 control received $22.5 billion 
in total ODA. Other ODA expenditure in 2022 comprised $3.7 billion on 
infectious disease control, $2.4 billion on malaria control and $2.2 billion on 
basic health care. By region, sub-Saharan Africa received the largest volume 
and share of aid for basic health care, amounting to $6.6 billion.

Quality education
•	
	Progress towards Goal 4 has been slow since 2015, with only 58 per 
cent of students worldwide achieving a minimum proficiency in reading 
by 2019. Recent assessments reveal a significant decline in math and 
reading scores in many countries, highlighting a set of factors beyond the 
COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on global education. 
•	
Many countries face challenges such as inadequate education 
infrastructure, teacher shortages and insufficient teacher training. While 
technology has expanded educational opportunities, it has also widened 
inequalities, leaving millions of people, especially in marginalized and 
low-income communities, without access to education.
•	
To meet national 2030 education targets, which have been scaled back 
compared to the original Goal 4 targets, countries must annually enrol 
1.4 million children in early childhood education, admit a new child 
to school every two seconds until 2030 and triple annual progress in 
primary completion rates. 
•	
Accelerating progress could have a catalytic impact on achieving the 
overall 2030 Agenda. Prioritizing increased education funding, teacher 
training, and inclusive and accessible schools are essential steps, along 
with leveraging technology and bridging the digital divide to achieve 
equitable access to quality education.

people in eastern Myanmar.
Global upper secondary school completion growth slows yet Eastern and South-Eastern Asia displays 
remarkable progress 
Between 2015 and 2023, the primary school completion rate increased 
from 85 to 88 per cent, the lower secondary completion rate from 74 to 78 
per cent, and the upper secondary completion rate from 53 to 59 per cent. 
However, only two in three children in sub-Saharan Africa complete primary 
school on time. 
Progress in upper secondary completion slowed from 1.3 percentage points 
annually (2010-2015) to 0.9 percentage points annually (2015–2023), with 
Oceania experiencing negative growth. Yet some regions made notable 
progress. Eastern and South-Eastern Asia was the fastest growing region, 
with the completion rate climbing from 63 per cent in 2015 to 74 per cent in 
2023.   
Globally, girls’ completion rates exceed those of boys by 2 to 3 percentage 
points in both primary and secondary education. At the upper secondary 
level, girls hold a notable advantage, with a 14 percentage-point gap 
in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, 8 points in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, and 4 to 5 points in most other regions. In Central and Southern 
Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, boys maintain a slight lead of 2 to 3 percentage 
points. These regional disparities underscore the need for targeted efforts to 
achieve equal educational opportunities for all children.
COVID-19 and other factors have exacerbated 
declines in reading and mathematics  
Based on the 2022 Programme for International Student Assessment test at 
the end of lower secondary school in 81 member and partner countries of the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), from 
2018 to 2022, mean performance in mathematics plummeted by a record 
15 points. Reading scores declined by 10 points, twice the previous record. 
Reading proficiency followed a downward trajectory for a decade prior to 
these results; mathematics scores were relatively stable from 2003 to 2018. 
An unprecedented drop highlights the profound impact of the COVID-19 
pandemic on global education.
Significant data shortfalls in tracking learning outcomes, especially in 
early education, pose challenges in assessing global trends and disparities 
among countries. With data available for only one in five countries at the 
end of primary school, recent initiatives to close the gaps show promise in 
expanding cross-national assessments. 
An urgent need for enhanced climate change and 
sustainability education and teacher training  
Although 90 per cent of countries report that they mainstream sustainable 
development and global citizenship subjects in national education systems, 
evidence suggests scattered uptake. A 2023 study of more than 530 ninth 
grade science and social science curricula found that 69 per cent did not 
mention climate change and 66 per cent omitted sustainability. Despite 
claims by some teachers that these topics were covered, 50 per cent 
admitted to not teaching them. Three quarters of countries expressed 
intentions to revise their curricula within the next three years to prioritize 
climate change and sustainability. Simply revising curricula may not be 
sufficient, however, if teachers lack the confidence or willingness to teach 
these subjects. Comprehensive support from schools, training institutions, 
communities and governments is essential to encourage educators to 
effectively transmit sustainability principles to future generations.

Universal pre-primary education is hindered by inadequate legal guarantees and financial barriers
Globally, pre-primary education has stagnated since the SDGs were agreed. 
Seven out of 10 children globally attended organized learning one year before 
the official primary entry age in 2022, a rate unchanged since 2015. In 
sub-Saharan Africa and Northern Africa and Western Asia, less than half of 
children attended pre-primary school, despite previous progress. 
COVID-19 reversed growth in pre-primary education, causing a decline of 
1.5 percentage points. This particularly impacted the poorest children, as 
pre-primary education can mitigate disadvantages. Legal guarantees for 
free and compulsory pre-primary education are crucial to school readiness 
and equal opportunities, yet only a quarter of countries make it compulsory 
and only half offer it for free. Financial barriers persist in regions where the 
private provision of education is prevalent; in sub-Saharan Africa, 32 per cent 
of pre-primary students attend private institutions. Overall, children from the 
richest households are twice as likely to attend preschool compared to those 
from the least affluent households.

Lags in basic services in schools continue to marginalize girls and students with disabilities 
Despite basic services in schools being essential for fair learning 
opportunities, progress has been slow, particularly affecting students with 
disabilities and girls. Globally, only half of primary schools and just 
62 per cent of secondary schools have basic infrastructure for students 
with disabilities. In Latin America and the Caribbean, only a third of primary 
schools can accommodate students with disabilities. Globally, over 
20 per cent of primary schools have no separate sanitation facilities for girls. 
A lack of handwashing facilities in 2 out of 10 schools poses health risks, 
especially during pandemics.
Between 2021 and 2022, the growth rate in schools’ Internet access for 
pedagogical purposes doubled globally and even tripled in some regions. At 
the upper secondary level, 91 per cent of schools had access to electricity, 
81 per cent had computers and 69 per cent were connected to the Internet. 
Significant disparities remained, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where 
less than a third of primary schools and about half of secondary schools had 
access to electricity, hindering the use of technology.
A substantial number of teachers are not trained according to minimum standards in their country  
Teachers are the single most important factor in student learning. Yet a 
significant teacher qualification gap persists globally. On average, 15 per cent 
of teachers lack minimum qualifications, constraining progress across all 
levels of education. 
Sub-Saharan Africa faces the steepest challenge, with only 60 per cent of 
pre-primary teachers meeting standards compared to 90 per cent in Europe 
and Northern America in 2022. At the primary level, 7 out of 10 teachers 
in sub-Saharan Africa met minimum required qualifications compared to 
9 out of 10 in most other regions. Teacher shortages and limited in-service 
training compound this problem, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where 
enrolment growth outpaces teacher hiring. Inconsistency in national 
teacher qualification standards further obstructs progress. The International 
Standard Classification of Teacher Training Programmes was endorsed in 
2021 to define a minimum global standard for trained teachers but has yet to 
be widely implemented.

•	
The world continues to lag in its pursuit of gender equality by 2030. 
Harmful practices are decreasing but not at a rate keeping up with 
population growth. One in five girls still marry before age 18. A 
staggering 230 million girls and women have been subjected to female 
genital mutilation. Far too many women still cannot realize the right to 
decide on their sexual and reproductive health. Violence against women 
persists, disproportionately affecting those with disabilities.
•	
Parity in women’s participation in public life remains elusive, and in 
management positions, at current rates, parity will require another 176 
years. Women carry an unfair burden of unpaid domestic and care work, 
spending 2.5 times more hours a day on it than men.
•	
Strong and sustained commitments to changing biased social norms, 
eliminating harmful practices and abolishing discriminatory laws are 
urgently needed. Enhancing women’s roles in leadership and decision-
making and adequately scaling up investments in gender equality on 
national, regional and global scales are top priorities. 
Gender equality
Women in the fishing industry in Burundi demonstrate against 
gender-based violence during an annual campaign for the elimination 
of violence against women.
The dismantling of discriminatory laws is encouraging but gaps persist, notably in land rights
Data from 120 countries show that from 2019 to 2023, 56 positive legal 
reforms focused on removing discriminatory laws and establishing legal 
frameworks to advance gender equality. Twenty-two reforms centred on 
equal rights to employment and economic benefits and 18 on stopping 
violence against women. The reforms included lifting restrictions on women 
working in specific sectors, guaranteeing equal remuneration for work of 
equal value and prohibiting marital rape. Gaps remain, however; no reporting 
country earned a perfect score across all areas of legislation.
Legal protections of women’s land rights remain grossly inadequate. Among 
77 countries, only 20 per cent has high levels of protection. Only 9 countries 
have legal provisions for financial resources to strengthen women’s land 
ownership. Just 23 countries have quotas ensuring women are represented 
in land administration or management institutions; 13 are in sub-Saharan 
Africa. 
Limited data mask far greater risks of intimate partner violence among women with disabilities 
Existing evidence shows that the prevalence of intimate partner violence, 
in all forms, is higher among women with disabilities than those without 
disabilities. Data from four countries in Asia and the Pacific indicate that 
in Mongolia, 41 per cent of women with disabilities has experienced 
physical violence by a partner compared to 28 per cent of women without 
disabilities. In Viet Nam, 1 in 5 women with disabilities has been subjected to 
sexual violence by an intimate partner compared to 2 in 15 women without 
disabilities. Differences in the prevalence of physical and/or sexual violence 
range from 6 to 16 percentage points in the four countries. 
Prevalence estimates are limited by the underrepresentation of women with 
disabilities in population-based surveys on violence against women and by 
the non-inclusion of forms of violence specific to women with disabilities. 
Without data, women with disabilities remain “invisible” in policies, 
prevention and response strategies.

Harmful practices are declining but not at rates keeping up with population growth
Child marriage and female genital mutilation violate the rights of girls and 
have lifelong consequences. An estimated 640 million girls and women were 
married in childhood globally, with one third in India alone. Some progress has 
been made. One in five girls was married before 18 today compared to one in 
four 25 years ago; 68 million child marriages were averted in this period. 
Over 230 million girls and women have undergone female genital mutilation. 
Some countries have made strides towards ending it, but new estimates show 
an increase of 30 million cases compared to eight years ago. In Africa, over 
144 million girls and women have undergone the practice, with notably high 
levels in Djibouti, Guinea and Somalia, where at least 90 per cent of girls and 
women are affected. Asia and the Middle East are home to significant numbers 
affected by female genital mutilation as well, at over 80 million and over 6 
million, respectively. Demographic trends pose challenges, as populations are 
projected to grow fastest in regions where harmful practices are common. 
Goal 5 | Gender equality
From legislatures to corporate boards, women have made insufficient gains in leadership 
Women’s political participation remains constrained. As of 1 January 2024, 
women occupied 26.9 per cent of seats in national parliaments, up from 
22.3 per cent in 2015. Only six countries had 50 per cent or more women 
in the lower or single chamber (Andorra, Cuba, Mexico, Nicaragua, Rwanda 
and the United Arab Emirates). Two lower chambers now have no women 
members (Oman and Yemen), down from five in 2015. In local government, 
women occupied 35.5 per cent of elected seats in 2023. Gender quotas 
largely determine progress.
While women hold 40 per cent of global employment, they only occupied 
27.5 per cent of managerial positions in 2022, the same share as in 2016. 
Parity in managerial roles will take 176 years at current rates of change, with 
discrimination, restrictive laws and inadequate social protection creating 
daunting barriers. Sub-Saharan Africa shows progress is possible. It has 
achieved an 11.3 percentage-point increase in female managers since 2000, 
reaching 38 per cent in 2022. The global increase was only 2.8 percentage 
points over the same period.  
Heavy burdens of unpaid domestic and care work trap women in poverty and inequality 
Despite variations across regions and country-specific differences, women in 
general perform most unpaid domestic and care work. This disproportionate 
burden is amplified in lower-income households, contributing to poverty, 
inequality and precariousness, including by limiting labour-market 
participation. 
On average, each day, women spend 2.5 times more hours on unpaid 
domestic and care work than men. Regional disparities are marked, at five 
times more in Northern Africa and Western Asia compared to about two 
times more in Oceania, Europe and Northern America. Differences are 
primarily attributed to men allocating more time to unpaid work than to 
regional differences among women’s engagement in unpaid labour. 
Women’s empowerment in sexual and reproductive health decisions remains restricted globally, 
although positive strides are evident in some places 
Data from 69 countries show that 56 per cent of married or in-union women 
aged 15–49 can decide on their sexual and reproductive health and rights, 
ranging from 38 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa to over 80 per cent in 
Europe. Although 89 per cent of women can autonomously decide to use 
contraception, one in four cannot make health-care decisions or say no to 
sex. New data from 32 countries show that 19 have seen a positive trend 
in women’s ability to make decisions on sexual and reproductive health, 
particularly in Eastern and Southern Africa. Conversely, Western and Central 
Africa has experienced notable declines.  
Socioeconomic factors such as household wealth, education and place of 
residence may shape these outcomes. For instance, data reveal shifts in the 
urban-rural gap, with some countries seeing decreased disparities and some, 
such as Armenia and Uganda, experiencing widening gaps. Understanding 
the trends is crucial in developing policies and programmes for vulnerable 
groups. Focusing on rural populations, the lowest wealth quintiles and 
individuals with limited education could help bridge significant gaps.

Clean water and 
sanitation
•	
Despite some improvements, progress in water and sanitation remains 
insufficient. At the current speed, in 2030, 2 billion people will still live 
without safely managed drinking water, 3 billion without safely managed 
sanitation and 1.4 billion without basic hygiene services. 
•	
In 2022, roughly half the world’s population experienced severe water 
scarcity for at least part of the year. One quarter faced “extremely 
high” levels of water stress. Climate change worsens these issues, 
posing significant risks to social stability. While 153 Member States 
share transboundary waters, only one region is on track to cover all 
transboundary rivers, lakes and aquifers with cooperation arrangements 
by 2030.
•	
	Sustainable management of water resources underpins prosperity and 
peace for all. It demands increased funding; more data-driven decision-
making; skilled workforce development; innovative technology, including 
artificial intelligence (AI); and robust cross-sector collaboration. 
Coordinated global action on integrated water management to address 
climate change impacts as well as better management of shared waters 
are also key.
A family washes vegetables in a sink outside their home in Guatemala. 
The local community has improved water, sanitation and hygiene 
services.
More people have safe drinking water and sanitation but billions still go without 
Between 2015 and 2022, the proportion of the population using safely 
managed drinking water increased from 69 to 73 per cent. Shares with 
safely managed sanitation rose from 49 to 57 per cent and with basic 
hygiene services from 67 to 75 per cent. In 2022, however, 2.2 billion people 
still lacked safely managed drinking water, 3.5 billion went without safely 
managed sanitation (including 419 million who practised open defecation) 
and 2 billion still had inadequate basic hygiene services (including 653 
million with no facilities at all). Additionally, 1.8 billion people had no 
on-premises drinking water, with women primarily responsible for water 
collection in two out of three households. Achieving universal coverage by 
2030 will require a sixfold increase in current rates of progress for safely 
managed drinking water, a fivefold increase for safely managed sanitation 
and a threefold increase for basic hygiene services.
Degraded water quality is likely a global trend yet data gaps constrain understanding and action
In 2022, based on 73 countries reporting both total wastewater generation 
and treatment, 76 per cent of total wastewater received some treatment. 
In 42 countries specifying treatment levels, 60 per cent of total wastewater 
flows were safely treated (with at least secondary treatment). Far fewer 
countries reported on the generation or treatment of industrial wastewater. 
Data on household wastewater from 140 countries and territories show that 
58 per cent received safe treatment. Trends in domestic wastewater suggest 
that little, if any, progress is being made towards the target of halving the 
proportion of unsafe discharges by 2030. Large gaps in monitoring and 
reporting, particularly in low-income countries, result in an unclear picture of 
global wastewater.
In 2023, data on 91,000 water bodies from 120 countries revealed that 
56 per cent had good water quality. Reporting on this indicator increased 
from 71 countries in 2017 to 120 in 2023. The 40 highest-income countries 
reported on 75 per cent of these water bodies, while 80 other countries 
reported on the remaining 25 per cent. More countries monitored rivers 
(101) than lakes and groundwater (71 each) due to technical challenges. 
This is concerning, as groundwater often constitutes the largest share of 
freshwater while lakes are vital ecosystems. Agriculture and untreated 
wastewater are major threats to water quality, releasing harmful excess 
nutrients. 
Degradation in water quality since 2017 is a concerning trend based on 
data from countries with extensive monitoring programmes. This trend may 
be global, given lower wastewater treatment rates in many low-income 
countries, but insufficient data limit confirmation. The lack of data obscures 
early warning signs, impedes restoration efforts and jeopardizes freshwater 
ecosystem services.
Permanent water bodies grew by over 2 per cent from 2005 to 2022
Using millions of satellite images, scientists mapped permanent water 
bodies globally from 2005 to 2022. The analysis revealed a net global 
increase of 2.1 per cent (53,672 km2) in permanent water area since 2005. 
Much of the increase comes from climate change and reservoir filling. While 
the global net gain in permanent water is positive, global data also reflect 
losses of permanent water linked to droughts and rising water demand in 
some regions, notably Australia and New Zealand, Latin America and the 
Caribbean, and Central Asia.

Global water use efficiency has risen by varying 
degrees depending on the structure of economies
Global water use efficiency increased from $17.4/m3 in 2015 to $20.8/m3 in 
2021, a 19 per cent increase in efficiency. Efficiency improved in all economic 
sectors. Agriculture saw the greatest rise, at 36 per cent, followed by 
industry at 31 per cent and services at 6.3 per cent. Efficiency varies widely, 
influenced by a country’s economic structure and the sectoral distribution of 
water. In 2021, estimates ranged from below $3/m3 in agriculture-dependent 
economies to over $50/m3 in highly industrialized, service-based ones.
Despite the average increase globally, around 58 per cent of countries still 
exhibit low water use efficiency (less than $20/m3). Regionally, Oceania, 
Europe and Northern America have exceeded the global average, while 
Central and Southern Asia are falling behind. From 2015 to 2021, Eastern 
Asia and South-Eastern Asia experienced growth of 44 per cent; Latin 
America and the Caribbean witnessed a 7 per cent decline. Countries are 
adopting various strategies to enhance water use efficiency, including 
infrastructure modernization, more efficient irrigation and wastewater reuse. 
Goal 6 | Clean water and sanitation
Much more effort is needed to realize the full 
potential of transboundary water cooperation 
Cooperative agreements among countries sharing transboundary water 
resources (rivers, lakes and aquifers) are essential for advancing sustainable 
development and addressing climate change. In 2024, only 43 out of 
153 Member States sharing transboundary waters have operational 
arrangements covering 90 per cent or more of these resources. Over 20 
countries lack any such arrangements. While progress has been notable 
in sub-Saharan Africa, where 16 countries now cover 90 per cent of their 
transboundary basins with operational arrangements, only a few countries 
in Asia, Latin America and North Africa have adequate arrangements. 
Alarmingly, nearly 43 per cent of countries lack flood alarm systems for any 
of their transboundary water bodies, 63 per cent go without drought alarm 
systems, 59 per cent have no joint climate change adaptation strategies 
for any of their transboundary basins and 64 per cent have yet to enact 
joint disaster risk reduction strategies. Since 2020, only around 10 new 
cooperation arrangements have been adopted for previously uncovered 
transboundary water bodies. Achieving coverage of all transboundary basins 
by 2030 will require significantly accelerated progress.
Integrated water management boosts resilience to multiple crises, including climate change
Tackling climate change, water scarcity and other crises requires a 
comprehensive approach to managing water resources, across sectors 
and borders. Countries with higher levels of integrated water resources 
management (score 0 to 100 per cent) are more resilient to climate change, 
biodiversity loss and pollution. Global progress in implementing integrated 
water resources management remains slow, however, edging up from a score 
of 49 per cent in 2017 to only 57 per cent in 2023, far short of the 2030 
target of 91 to 100 per cent. Significant efforts to accelerate implementation 
are needed, particularly in Central and Southern Asia, Latin America and 
the Caribbean, Oceania and sub-Saharan Africa. Countries report that their 
main challenges are the lack of coordination across sectors and insufficient 
financial, institutional and technical capacity. Successful countries 
demonstrate that mainstreaming water resources in climate planning and 
financing allows them to build resilience and advance multiple development 
objectives, including for food, energy and ecosystems.
Water stress is increasing, with devastating consequences for sustainable development
The water stress level measures all freshwater withdrawals relative to total 
freshwater resources. A withdrawal rate above 75 per cent of renewable 
water resources represents high water stress; more than 100 per cent 
is critical. High water stress can have devastating consequences for the 
environment and hinder or even reverse economic and social development. 
Globally, the water stress level reached an average of 18.6 per cent in 2021, 
with Central and Southern Asia facing high stress and Northern Africa in 
critical stress. From 2015 to 2021, global water stress increased by 3 per 
cent. Stress levels in Northern Africa and Western Asia rose 12 per cent, 
exacerbating already critical levels. Agriculture accounts for 72 per cent 
of freshwater withdrawals globally, followed by industry (15 per cent) and 
services (13 per cent).

Affordable and clean 
energy
•	
Considerable strides have been made in achieving sustainable energy 
targets. The number of people lacking access to electricity dropped from 
958 million in 2015 to 685 million in 2022. The number without clean 
cooking fuels declined from 2.8 billion to 2.1 billion over the same period. 
Global capacity to generate electricity from renewable energy has begun 
expanding at an unprecedented rate, a trend expected to continue.
•	
Recent events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, 
have disrupted progress, including by exacerbating already insufficient 
international financial flows for clean energy in developing countries. 
Without a change in course, an estimated 660 million people will still 
lack electricity access and around 1.8 billion will go without clean cooking 
fuels and technologies by 2030.
•	
To achieve universal access to clean energy by 2030, robust policies 
are needed to accelerate electrification, enhance energy efficiency 
and increase investments in renewable energy. These efforts, coupled 
with fostering innovative solutions and creating supportive regulatory 
frameworks, are pivotal to advance towards Goal 7 and meet climate 
objectives. 
Workers install solar panels to power a public hospital in Yemen, 
restoring operations affected by ongoing conflict. 
The number of people lacking electricity access grew for the first time in a decade 
 In 2022, although the global electricity access rate held steady at 91 per 
cent, 685 million people still lacked electricity, 10 million more than in 
2021 due to population growth. This marked the first such increase in a 
decade. The setback is largely attributed to the disruptions of the COVID-19 
pandemic and Ukraine conflict, which affected energy prices and markets. 
Those without access to electricity are predominantly in low-income 
households or located in remote areas. 
Progress varies by region. Central and Southern Asia reduced the regional 
gap from 235 million people in 2015 to 33 million in 2022. Sub-Saharan 
Africa had a growing share of the global access deficit, at 83 per cent (or 
570 million people) in 2022, up from 50 per cent in 2010. While access to 
electricity grew globally at 0.77 per cent annually on average from 2010 to 
2020, the rate slowed to 0.43 per cent from 2020 to 2022. With projections 
indicating that 660 million people globally will remain unserved by 2030, 
achieving universal electricity access will require a 1.08 per cent annual 
increase. Investing in decentralized renewable energy, including stand-alone 
off-grid solar and mini-grids, together with electricity-as-a-service models 
holds significant potential to bridge the access gap. 
Without faster progress, by 2030, around 1.8 billion people will still prepare meals using polluting 
stoves and fuels  
In 2022, 74 per cent of the global population had access to clean cooking. 
The global access deficit fell to 26 per cent, down from 36 per cent in 2015. 
This still leaves around 2.1 billion people relying on polluting fuels and 
technologies, such as wood, charcoal, dung and crop waste, as their primary 
energy source for cooking. Without stepped-up interventions, around 1.8 
billion people or 21 per cent of the world’s population could lack access to 
clean cooking by 2030. 
Among the regions, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and Central and 
Southern Asia have seen consistent improvements. By contrast, sub-Saharan 
Africa remains the only region where the deficit is rising; it could exceed 
1 billion people without access by 2030. Globally, urban-rural disparities 
are stark, with 88 per cent of urban households compared to 54 per cent 
of rural households having access to clean cooking solutions. A reliance on 
traditional stoves and polluting fuels worsens health and environmental risks, 
particularly for women and children, who bear the brunt of cooking and fuel 
collection burdens.

Electricity is at the forefront in the shift to global renewable energy; hurdles remain in heating and 
transport 
The share of renewable energy in the world’s total final energy consumption 
rose from 16.7 per cent in 2015 to 18.7 per cent in 2021. Excluding traditional 
forms of biomass, the share of modern renewable sources climbed gradually 
from 10 per cent in 2015 to 12.5 per cent in 2021. Traditional uses of biomass 
accounted for slightly over a third of total renewable energy consumption.  
The electricity sector has emerged as a frontrunner in adopting wind and 
solar technologies due to their declining costs. Renewables constituted over 
28.2 per cent of total final energy consumption for electricity in 2021, up 
from 22.9 per cent in 2015. This signals how the world’s capacity to generate 
renewable power is expanding at an unprecedented rate, presenting a 
tangible opportunity to triple global capacity by 2030, as agreed at the 
twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2023. Yet increases 
in renewable energy use remain constrained in the heating and transport 
sectors, which account for four fifths of total final energy consumption.

Impressive overall average gains in electricity generated with renewables obscure slow progress in 
some places  
 Globally, per capita installed capacity for generating electricity with 
renewable energy nearly doubled from 250 watts in 2015 to 424 watts in 
2022. The past five years saw an all-time high compound annual growth rate 
of 8.1 per cent. Developing countries witnessed substantial expansion from 
155 to 293 renewable watts per capita. Developed countries saw a milder 
rise from 691 to 1,073 watts per capita, even as they have 3.7 times more 
installed capacity than developing nations. Disparities are more evident for 
the LDCs, LLDCs and small island developing States, which in 2022 achieved 
40, 103 and 101 watts per capita, respectively. At current rates of expansion, 
LDCs would require nearly 41 years, LLDCs 38 years and small island 
developing States 11 years to match the 2022 levels in developing countries. 
This wide divide indicates an urgent need to bridge gaps in achieving 
equitable access to sustainable energy.

Global investment needs to triple to rectify marginal gains in energy efficiency  
 Global primary energy intensity improved from 4.9 megajoules per dollar 
(2017 purchasing power parity) in 2015 to 4.6 in 2021. The energy intensity 
improvement rate for 2021 was only 0.8 per cent, however, influenced by a 
robust economic recovery after the pandemic and a shift towards energy-
intensive industries. The rate has remained under the 1.2 per cent average 
observed during the last five years. 
To meet the Goal 7 energy efficiency target by 2030, annual improvements 
must now average around 4 per cent. Key actions include switching to more 
efficient fuels, such as by electrifying final uses and providing universal 
access to clean cooking. Improving the technical efficiency of equipment 
and processes and using energy and materials more efficiently are also 
important. Further, global investment in energy efficiency would need 
to triple by 2030. High interest rates pose a challenge as financing new 
projects has become more expensive, particularly in emerging markets and 
developing economies.
International public financial flows for clean energy rebounded in 2022 but remain insufficient   
In 2022, international public financial flows supporting clean energy in 
developing countries rebounded to $15.4 billion, an increase of 25 per cent 
over 2021 yet still around half the 2016 peak of $28.5 billion. This declining 
trend could impede progress towards Goal 7, especially for the LDCs, LLDCs 
and small island development States.  
Financing commitments have become marginally more widely distributed. In 
2021, 80 per cent of commitments went to 19 countries, a figure rising to 25 
in 2022. Trends in technology over the last decade have shifted investments 
from hydropower to solar energy and multiple/other renewables. In 2022, 
almost half of flows went to multiple/other renewables. Solar energy 
received 35 per cent, wind energy 11 per cent and hydropower 7 per cent.

Decent work and 
economic growth
•	
Progress towards Goal 8 faces headwinds from the COVID-19 aftermath, 
trade tensions, rising debt in developing countries, conflicts and 
geopolitical strains – collectively threatening global economic growth. 
While global real GDP per capita growth rebounded in 2021, it slowed in 
2022 and is projected to stabilize through 2025.
•	
	Global unemployment hit a historic low of 5 per cent in 2023 yet 
persistent roadblocks remain in achieving decent work. Women and 
youth face higher unemployment rates. Informal employment poses a 
significant global challenge, with over 2 billion workers in informal jobs 
lacking social protection in 2023. In the LDCs, and in sub-Saharan Africa 
and Central and Southern Asia, nearly 9 in 10 workers are informally 
employed. Alarmingly, over one in five young people are not in education, 
employment or training (NEET). Compliance with fundamental labour 
rights has deteriorated.
•	
Accelerating progress demands sustainable economic policies, support 
for entrepreneurship and innovation, formalization of the informal 
economy, safeguards of workers’ rights, social justice, and inclusive 
employment opportunities, especially for women and youth.
Global GDP growth has waned and productivity is stagnant, posing risks to economic development 
Global real GDP per capita grew at an average annual rate of 2.1 per cent 
from 2010 to 2014, slowing to 1.6 per cent from 2015 to 2022. The decline 
stemmed from slower growth in most regions and decreases in sub-Saharan 
Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Oceania (excluding Australia 
and New Zealand). Global real GDP per capita inched up 1.8 per cent 
annually from 2015 to 2019 but fell by 3.9 per cent in 2020 before recovering 
with a 5.3 per cent increase in 2021. Growth slowed to 2.2 per cent in 2022 
and is estimated to further drop to 1.0 per cent in 2023. The projected 
growth rate will be 1.8 per cent in 2024 and 1.5 per cent in 2025.
Annual growth in real GDP in the LDCs retreated from 5.1 per cent in 2019 to 
just 0.7 per cent in 2020 before partially recovering to 3.8 per cent in 2021. 
Growth strengthened to 4.6 per cent in 2022 and is predicted to rise by 4.4 
per cent in 2023, 5.5 per cent in 2024 and 4.9 per cent in 2025, still well 
below the 7 per cent target.
Annual growth in economic productivity, defined as the growth rate of real 
GDP per employed person, stagnated in 2022 and 2023 below 0.5 per cent, 
a stark contrast to the period from 2015 to 2019, when the average growth 
rate exceeded 1.5 per cent. The pandemic interrupted this trend, with 2020 
registering a 1.1 per cent decline as output fell faster than employment, 
although this was fully offset by a short-lived rebound in 2021. The slow pace 
of productivity growth in the last two years poses a risk to economic growth 
and development.
Workers operate a production line in an electronics factory in 
Viet Nam.
The global youth NEET rate dipped after the pandemic but stark gender disparities persist
In 2023, the global NEET rate among young people was 21.7 per cent, a 
notable decrease from 23.8 per cent in 2020. It closely matched the 2015 
baseline of 21.8 per cent and is expected to persist through 2025. Northern 
Africa and Western Asia and Central and Southern Asia reported higher 
rates of 28.5 per cent and 27.4 per cent, respectively. Central and Southern 
Asia saw significant improvement, reducing its rate by 7.5 percentage points 
since 2005. Sub-Saharan Africa experienced an increase. Globally, young 
women are over twice as likely as young men to be NEET. In Central and 
Southern Asia, nearly half of young women are NEET compared to only 
12.3 per cent of young men. Northern Africa and Western Asia echo this 
disparity. With about 269 million young people globally not in education 
or work in 2023, intensified efforts are needed to reduce NEET rates, 
particularly among young women.
Fewer countries had an operationalized national strategy for youth 
employment in 2023 compared to previous years. Only 36 of 87 reporting 
countries had implemented such a strategy. Around one third had a strategy 
but without evidence of implementation. One fifth were developing one.

Substantial declines in labour rights plague all regions, worsening prospects for social justice 
From 2015 to 2022, the global average level of national compliance with 
labour rights declined by 7 per cent, with the average score worsening 
from 4.50 to 4.81. This indicator, ranging from 0 to 10, signifies national 
compliance with freedom of association and collective bargaining rights, with 
0 indicating the highest compliance and 10 the lowest. The deterioration 
has affected developed, developing and least developed countries, with 
decreases of 0.2, 0.3 and 0.8 points, respectively, since 2020. Scores have 
worsened for 33 per cent of International Labour Organization (ILO) member 
States since 2020; only 11 per cent have improved their scores, partly due to 
legislative reforms. Regional averages reflect substantial declines in Eastern 
and South-Eastern Asia, Central and Southern Asia, Europe and Northern 
America and Latin America. Northern Africa and Western Asia saw marginal 
improvements. Increased violations and restrictions on civil liberties, 
especially in union formation and bargaining rights, drive the trend. Freedom 
of association and collective bargaining are enabling rights to exercise 
fundamental rights at work, with a crucial role in social justice.
Global unemployment fell to a record low yet gaps remain for women and youth
In 2023, the global unemployment rate fell to a record low of 5.0 per cent 
since 2000. The rate is projected to further drop to 4.9 per cent in 2024 and 
to stay the same level in 2025. Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, the LDCs 
and LLDCs saw unemployment rates rise from 2019 to 2023. Northern 
Africa and Western Asia had the highest rate at 9.5 per cent, despite 
declines since the pandemic. Women and youth continued to face higher 
rates globally and across regions. In 2023, gender unemployment gaps were 
similar to those in 2015, with the largest disparities in Northern Africa and 
Western Asia. Central and Southern Asia has made strides in narrowing 
the gap due to improved labour market access for women, particularly in 
Southern Asia. Youth unemployment was over three times higher than adult 
rates globally, at 13.0 per cent compared to 3.7 per cent, respectively. While 
headline unemployment figures improved, persistent challenges such as 
working poverty and informal employment highlight ongoing struggles in 
realizing decent work.
Goal 8 | Decent work and economic growth
More than 2 billion workers globally were in informal employment in 2023
Globally, over 2 billion people were in informal employment in 2023, 
comprising 58.0 per cent of the global workforce, a share projected to 
slightly decrease to 57.8 per cent in 2024. This rate is down from 58.4 
per cent in 2015, reaching its lowest point, but the number of informal 
workers is at its highest level. This suggests that widespread formalization 
is unlikely soon. Economic challenges are pushing workers into informal 
jobs without social protection, a significant barrier to social justice. Informal 
employment persisted most notably in the LDCs at 89.1 per cent in 2023, a 
rate nearly unchanged since 2015. The rate in Europe and Northern America 
was only 11.4 per cent. Women, particularly in the LDCs and regions with 
high informality rates, experienced a disproportionate increase in informal 
employment during the pandemic. Over 90 per cent of employed women 
in the LDCs and nearly 90 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa and Central and 
Southern Asia performed informal work.
A crucial sector of many economies, tourism is mostly on the rebound post-pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic inflicted unprecedented damage on tourism. Its 
contribution to the global economy plummeted from 3.8 per cent of GDP in 
2019 to 1.8 per cent in 2020. In 2022, the sector rebounded to 82 per cent 
of its 2019 level, contributing to 3.1 per cent of global GDP, as it tapped pent-
up demand following the end of travel restrictions and resumption of air 
connections. While most regions are nearing 2019 levels, challenges persist 
for Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and the small island 
developing States, with the economic performance of tourism at 68 per 
cent and 43 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, respectively. Tourism remains 
crucial for jobs, local ecosystems, peacebuilding and poverty reduction 
through income generation and tax revenues. Challenges such as inflation, 
climate change, geopolitical conflicts and uneven economic recovery 
threaten the sustainable development of the sector, particularly in small 
island developing States, which rely heavily on tourism.

Industry, innovation and 
infrastructure
•	
	Since 2022, manufacturing sector growth has plateaued at around 
2.7 per cent, a level expected to persist into 2024 due to the lingering 
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions. The 
medium- and high-tech sector maintained its manufacturing value 
added share at around 46 per cent in 2021. The air transport industry is 
rebounding strongly. Small enterprises continue to face hurdles such as 
limited access to credit, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and the LDCs; 
only around 17 per cent has access to loans or credit lines.
•	
	Despite reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions intensity, global 
emissions have hit a record high. The mobile broadband coverage gap 
persists at 5 per cent. 
•	
	To accelerate progress towards Goal 9, a concerted effort is needed to 
promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, foster innovation 
through increased investment in research and development, prioritize 
and accelerate the green transition, and facilitate access to information 
and communications technology.
Global manufacturing shows slow growth, and the global share of manufacturing employment declines
Since 2015, the global manufacturing value added per capita has risen by 
16 per cent, from $1,653 (at constant 2015 prices) to $1,922 in 2023. The 
manufacturing sector’s contribution to total economic activity, however, 
only marginally increased from 16.3 to 16.7 per cent during the same period. 
In 2022, manufacturing growth plateaued at around 2.7 per cent and is 
anticipated to remain stagnant in 2024. This can be attributed to factors 
including geopolitical uncertainty, inflation, logistical challenges, elevated 
energy costs and broader global economic deceleration.
In the LDCs, manufacturing value added per capita increased by 35 per 
cent from $125 in 2015 to $169 in 2023, with the share of manufacturing 
value added in GDP rising by 2.5 percentage points, from 12 to 14.5 per cent, 
respectively. Even so, the pace of progress may not be sufficient for the LDCs 
to reach the target of doubling their 2015 level of manufacturing value added 
in GDP by 2030.
Between 2015 and 2020, the global share of manufacturing employment in 
total employment remained relatively stable at 14.3 per cent. It dropped to 
14.1 per cent in 2022, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical 
crises that profoundly affected manufacturing sectors worldwide. Most 
regions witnessed a decline in the share of manufacturing employment 
between 2021 and 2022, except for sub-Saharan Africa and Central and 
Southern Asia.

After a pandemic-induced plunge, the airline industry begins a strong rebound
In 2020, international passenger traffic plunged by 60 per cent, with just 1.8 
billion passengers taking to the air compared to 4.5 billion in 2019, reverting 
to 2003 levels. Seat capacity was cut in half. In the same year, airlines 
suffered $370 billion in losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Airports and 
air navigation services providers lost $115 billion and $13 billion, respectively.
A strong recovery began in 2022 as passenger numbers reached 73 per 
cent and revenues hit 87 per cent of 2019 levels. Air passenger numbers 
increased by 43 per cent and revenue passenger kilometres rose by 62 
per cent over 2021 levels, driven by international route recoveries. Airlines 
experienced a 44 per cent growth in annual passenger revenues from 2021 
to 2022. 
In 2024, the air transport industry is expected to support 87.7 million 
jobs globally, with a direct and indirect economic impact of $3.5 trillion, 
equivalent to 4.1 per cent of world GDP.

Access to credit is vital for small enterprises, but only a small share can obtain it
Small enterprises are the backbone of economies worldwide, providing 
job opportunities and supporting livelihoods across communities. Despite 
playing a pivotal role in closing economic and social gaps, they face myriad 
challenges in the aftermath of the pandemic, including rising operational 
expenses due to inflation in energy and transportation and high interest 
rates on loans. Especially in lower-income nations, small enterprises bear the 
brunt of shocks due to their greater vulnerability. Access to credit, crucial for 
their survival, remains difficult. According to survey data from 2006 to 2023, 
only 16.9 per cent of small-scale manufacturing industries in sub-Saharan 
Africa received loans or lines of credit, well below the global average of 31 
per cent. Inclusive industrial policies are imperative for fostering the growth, 
competitiveness and resilience of small enterprises.
Goal 9 | Industry, innovation and infrastructure
Closing the mobile broadband coverage gap of 5 per cent remains a challenge 
In most developing countries, mobile broadband (3G or above) is the main 
way – and often the only way – to connect to the Internet. Around 95 per 
cent of the global population now has this form of access. Bridging the 
“coverage gap” for the remaining 5 per cent poses significant challenges. 
Since surpassing the 90 per cent mark in 2018, global 3G coverage has 
increased by only 4 percentage points. In Oceania (excluding Australia and 
New Zealand), the gap remains substantial at 31 per cent. Sub-Saharan 
Africa has seen some progress but still faces a notable 17 per cent gap, 
especially in central and western Africa. Mobile broadband remains 
inaccessible to 18 per cent of people in the LDCs and LLDCs.
Continued declines in CO2 emissions intensity are not yet enough to cut global emissions
In 2023, global CO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial 
processes increased by 1.1 per cent to an unprecedented 37.4 gigatons. 
The rate rose at a slower pace compared to 1.3 per cent in 2022 and was 
significantly lower than the global GDP growth rate of 3 per cent. This 
deceleration can be attributed to the significant surge in clean energy 
technologies since 2019. Coal was the primary driver of emissions growth, 
contributing over 65 per cent of the uptick in 2023. 
Emissions per unit of GDP consistently decreased, dropping 11.5 per cent 
from 0.29 kilograms per dollar (purchasing power parity) in 2015 to 0.25 
in 2021. In manufacturing, emissions intensity decreased by 16 per cent, 
although regional disparities persisted. Progress in reducing emissions 
intensity to cut global emissions overall has been insufficient. Developing 
strategies for low-carbon energy and green manufacturing calls for 
collaboration and approaches tailored to each country’s unique strengths.
Medium- and high-tech industry demonstrate resilience despite global economic challenges
The proportion of medium- and high-tech manufacturing value added in 
total value added rose from 46.34 per cent in 2015 to 46.88 per cent in 
2019, an upward trend slightly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 
crisis highlighted the resilience of higher-technology industries, which 
experienced only a marginal decline of 0.67 percentage points in 2021. 
Significant regional disparities exist in shares of medium- and high-tech 
manufacturing. In Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, the sector accounted 
for approximately 50.6 per cent of total manufacturing in 2021, whereas in 
sub-Saharan Africa, it represented just 18.3 per cent. Prioritizing investments 
in education and skills development is crucial to expedite the growth of 
medium- and high-tech industries by equipping the workforce to compete 
effectively in a dynamic global manufacturing landscape.
