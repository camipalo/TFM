Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,Countries have made strides in meeting obligations under international environmental agreements on hazardous waste and other chemicals and implementing comprehensive approaches to combat environmental degradation.,Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"In 2022, global food waste reached 1.05 billion metric tons, yet only 9 of 193 countries included food waste in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) on climate change actions.",Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"Progress largely depends on robust regulatory frameworks, financial incentives and public awareness campaigns.",Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,The world wastes 1.05 billion metric tons of food even as hundreds of millions face hunger,Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"Most food waste occurred in households (60 per cent); each person wasted an average of 79 kilograms annually, more than the weight of the average person.",Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"Globally, an estimated 1 billion meals of edible food are wasted every day, equivalent to 1.3 meals per person impacted by hunger per day, considering that 783 million people faced hunger in 2022.",Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"Hotter countries tend to have higher waste per capita, possibly due to increased consumption of fresh food with substantial inedible parts and inadequate refrigeration.",Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"At the same time, as of 2022, only 9 of 193 countries had included food waste in their NDCs, revealing a significant gap in connecting this issue with climate action and the objective of halving food waste and reducing losses by 2030.",Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"Uncontrolled disposal of electronic and electrical equipment fuels vast e-waste stockpiles, exacerbated by rising consumption, short product life cycles and little repair.",Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"High-income countries achieved collection rates of over 40 per cent, yet most e-waste was inadequately recycled or exported to lower-income countries where management infrastructure is not developed, inadequate or absent.",Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"In Central and Southern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa, collection rates are below 5 per cent.",Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,Inappropriate management by the informal sector results in environmental pollution and health hazards for workers and communities.,Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"By 2030, e-waste generation is projected to increase to 10 kilograms per capita per year (or 82 million metric tons in total).",Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"If all countries boost their collection rates to 60 per cent, 54 million metric tons of e-waste would be managed in an environmentally sound manner, with 30 million metric tons of metal resources viably recovered.",Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"This would also prevent 34,000 kilograms of mercury emissions and 209 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions in 2030.",Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,Half the policies are national road maps or strategies; 30 per cent are legal instruments; and 14 per cent are voluntary instruments.,Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,International standard setters have developed sustainability reporting standards for both the public and private sectors.,Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"While this represents positive progress, challenges persist given a lack of interoperability and inconsistency in national reporting requirements.",Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"Reporting is more common on environmental (water, emissions and energy efficiency) and governance (gender diversity, board meetings, bribery and corruption) dimensions than on social ones (human rights, health and safety, diversity and opportunity).",Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"The number of stock exchanges with written guidance on environmental, social and governance reporting continues to grow, from fewer than 10 a decade ago to 69 in 2022.",Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,Global material consumption growth slows but regional disparities persist,Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"The compound annual growth rate slowed, however, from 3.9 per cent in 2003–2012 to 0.8 per cent in 2013–2022.",Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,Its compound annual growth rate declined from 3.9 per cent in 2003–2012 to 0.9 per cent in 2013–2022.,Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"In regions where the material footprint exceeds domestic material consumption, the latter decelerates faster, notably in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, Europe and Northern America, and Northern Africa and Western Asia.",Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"In regions where the material footprint is lower than domestic material consumption, including Central and Southern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania, the compound annual growth rate decreased from 4.5 to 1.3 per cent for the former and from 3.8 to 1.6 per cent for the latter from 2003–2012 to 2013–2022.",Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"In 2019, a record 99 countries used at least one table under the accounts for evaluating key tourism sustainability indicators.",Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,A subsequent decline in use from 2020 to 2022 was likely due to a natural lag in data production.,Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"While global monitoring capacities have improved across all regions since 2008, in most, less than 50 per cent of countries can report data.",Inference
