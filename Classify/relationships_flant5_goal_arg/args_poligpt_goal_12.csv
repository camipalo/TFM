Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"Achieving sustainable consumption and production requires fostering circular economy models, sustainable production practices, and responsible consumption.",Inference,Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"Robust regulatory frameworks, financial incentives, and public awareness campaigns are necessary to support sustainable consumption and production.",Inference,Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"Household food waste varies by just 7 kilograms per capita each year across high-income, upper-middle-income, and lower-middle-income countries.",Inference,Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,Hotter countries tend to have higher waste per capita due to increased consumption of fresh food with substantial inedible parts and inadequate refrigeration.,Inference,Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"Food loss and waste generate 8 to 10 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, costing over $1 trillion and straining land resources and biodiversity.",Inference,Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"Uncontrolled disposal of electronic and electrical equipment fuels vast e-waste stockpiles, exacerbated by rising consumption, short product life cycles, and little repair.",Inference,Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"E-waste generation is projected to increase to 10 kilograms per capita per year by 2030, with only 22 per cent collected and managed sustainably.",Inference,Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"Boosting collection rates to 60 per cent could manage 54 million metric tons of e-waste in an environmentally sound manner and prevent 34,000 kilograms of mercury emissions and 209 million metric tons of CO2-equivalent emissions.",Inference,Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"More countries and companies are reporting on sustainability measures, with 62 Member States and the European Union reporting 516 policy instruments from 2019 to 2023.",Inference,Inference
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"International standard setters have developed sustainability reporting standards for both the public and private sectors, but challenges persist due to a lack of interoperability and inconsistency in national reporting requirements.",Inference,Conflict
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns,"Domestic material consumption grew by 69 per cent from 2000 to 2022, while the global material footprint increased by 71 per cent, with regional disparities in growth rates and environmental pressure.",Inference,Conflict
