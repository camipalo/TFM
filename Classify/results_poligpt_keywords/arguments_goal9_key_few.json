    "Manufacturing sector growth has plateaued at around 2.7 per cent due to the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions.",
    "The medium- and high-tech sector maintained its manufacturing value added share at around 46 per cent in 2021.",
    "The air transport industry is rebounding strongly.",
    "Small enterprises continue to face hurdles such as limited access to credit, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and the LDCs; only around 17 per cent has access to loans or credit lines.",
    "Despite reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions intensity, global emissions have hit a record high.",
    "The mobile broadband coverage gap persists at 5 per cent.",
    "To accelerate progress towards Goal 9, a concerted effort is needed to promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, foster innovation through increased investment in research and development, prioritize and accelerate the green transition, and facilitate access to information and communications technology.",
    "Global manufacturing shows slow growth, and the global share of manufacturing employment declines.",
    "The manufacturing sector’s contribution to total economic activity only marginally increased from 16.3 to 16.7 per cent between 2015 and 2023.",
    "In 2022, manufacturing growth plateaued at around 2.7 per cent and is anticipated to remain stagnant in 2024 due to factors including geopolitical uncertainty, inflation, logistical challenges, elevated energy costs and broader global economic deceleration.",
    "The pace of progress may not be sufficient for the LDCs to reach the target of doubling their 2015 level of manufacturing value added in GDP by 2030.",
    "Most regions witnessed a decline in the share of manufacturing employment between 2021 and 2022, except for sub-Saharan Africa and Central and Southern Asia.",
    "Access to credit is vital for small enterprises, but only a small share can obtain it.",
    "Small enterprises face myriad challenges in the aftermath of the pandemic, including rising operational expenses due to inflation in energy and transportation and high interest rates on loans.",
    "Inclusive industrial policies are imperative for fostering the growth, competitiveness and resilience of small enterprises.",
    "Closing the mobile broadband coverage gap of 5 per cent remains a challenge.",
    "Continued declines in CO2 emissions intensity are not yet enough to cut global emissions.",
    "Global CO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial processes increased by 1.1 per cent to an unprecedented 37.4 gigatons in 2023.",
    "The rate of increase in CO2 emissions rose at a slower pace compared to 1.3 per cent in 2022 and was significantly lower than the global GDP growth rate of 3 per cent.",
    "Coal was the primary driver of emissions growth, contributing over 65 per cent of the uptick in 2023.",
    "Emissions per unit of GDP consistently decreased, dropping 11.5 per cent from 0.29 kilograms per dollar (purchasing power parity) in 2015 to 0.25 in 2021.",
    "In manufacturing, emissions intensity decreased by 16 per cent, although regional disparities persisted.",
    "Developing strategies for low-carbon energy and green manufacturing calls for collaboration and approaches tailored to each country’s unique strengths.",
    "The proportion of medium- and high-tech manufacturing value added in total value added rose from 46.34 per cent in 2015 to 46.88 per cent in 2019, an upward trend slightly disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
    "Significant regional disparities exist in shares of medium- and high-tech manufacturing.",
    "Prioritizing investments in education and skills development is crucial to expedite the growth of medium- and high-tech industries by equipping the workforce to compete effectively in a dynamic global manufacturing landscape."
