    "Over half the world’s population currently resides in cities, yet urban areas confront myriad complex challenges.",
    "Globally, approximately one quarter of the urban population lives in slums, with the total slum population reaching 1.1 billion in 2022.",
    "The lack of equitable access to public transportation is a significant concern, particularly in LDCs, where only 4 in 10 individuals have convenient access.",
    "While air pollution levels have declined in most regions, they are still significantly higher than the recommended air quality guidelines for public health protection.",
    "Only 40 per cent of city dwellers can easily reach open public spaces.",
    "Between 2000 and 2020, cities sprawled up to 3.7 times faster than they densified, resulting in negative impacts on the natural environment and land use.",
    "With urbanization on the rise and nearly 70 per cent of the global population projected to reside in cities by 2050, the development of critical infrastructure, affordable housing, efficient transport systems and essential social services is imperative to create resilient and sustainable cities that meet the needs of all.",
    "In 2022, 24.8 per cent of the urban population lived in slums or informal settlements, slightly lower than 25 per cent in 2015 but higher than 24.2 per cent in 2020.",
    "The total slum population was 1.12 billion in 2022, 130 million more than in 2015, marking a reversal from the consistent decrease observed from 2000 to 2020.",
    "Urban sprawl is characterized by the unplanned, low-density, uncontrolled expansion of urban areas into previously undeveloped rural or suburban areas.",
    "This unregulated growth has negative impacts on the natural environment and land use, contributing to increased air pollution and the loss of open spaces, wildlife habitats and agricultural land.",
    "Cities sprawled or grew outwards up to 3.7 times faster than they densified or grew upward from 2000 to 2020, based on recent data from 1,217 cities in 185 countries.",
    "Each year, an estimated 4.2 million people die due to ambient air pollution.",
    "Globally, the population-weighted exposure to fine particulate matter dropped from 39.1 µg/m3 in 2010–2014 to 35.7 µg/m3 in 2015–2019, a 9 per cent decline.",
    "Yet the level remains significantly higher than the recommended air quality guideline of 5 µg/m3 for public health protection.",
    "Only 6 in 10 urban residents have convenient access to public transit, based on data collected in 2023 from 2,039 cities in 188 countries.",
    "The shortfall is particularly problematic in the LDCs, where less than 4 in 10 urban residents have accessible public transportation options, compared to 8 in 10 in more affluent regions.",
    "Only 44 per cent of urban residents have an open public space conveniently located within a 400-metre walk, according to 2020 data from 1,365 cities across 187 countries.",
    "This lack of access disproportionately impacts people in the LDCs, where less than 30 per cent of urban dwellers can conveniently access open public spaces."
