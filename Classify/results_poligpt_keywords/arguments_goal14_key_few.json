    "Oceans face significant challenges from eutrophication, worsening acidification, declining fish stocks, rising temperatures and widespread pollution.",
    "Efforts to address these mounting concerns remain uneven.",
    "Comprehensive global action is under way, yet it must accelerate.",
    "The sustainability of global fishery resources declined from 90.0 per cent in 1974 to 64.6 per cent in 2019 and further to 62.3 per cent in 2021, due to overfishing, pollution, poor management and other factors.",
    "Overfishing can harm biodiversity, ecosystems and fisheries production, and imposes adverse social and economic costs.",
    "Effective fisheries management can possibly reverse these effects and lead to optimal stock levels while supporting global food security and coastal communities.",
    "The ongoing albeit decelerated decline in biologically sustainable fish stocks worldwide underscores the need for enhanced regulatory frameworks and efficient monitoring systems.",
    "Record high ocean temperatures have triggered a fourth global coral bleaching event.",
    "Rising ocean temperatures are raising new concerns for coral reefs, which support a quarter of marine species, provide resources for hundreds of millions of people in coastal communities and generate trillions of dollars in revenue annually.",
    "As oceans continue to warm amid rising global temperatures, the frequency and severity of coral bleaching will likely increase.",
    "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that up to 90 per cent of corals could be lost by 2050 at 1.5°C of warming and up to 99 per cent at 2°C.",
    "The survival of coral reefs is vital for ocean health and humanity’s well-being.",
    "Global agreements could renew momentum to protect key biodiversity areas in the oceans.",
    "Marine designations should be strategically located to safeguard key biodiversity areas.",
    "Less than 30 per cent of marine key biodiversity areas in Oceania, Central and Southern Asia, and Northern Africa and Western Asia are protected, however, highlighting a critical need for action within the next six years.",
    "The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework commits to establishing protected areas to safeguard areas of particular importance for biodiversity, adding up to cover 30 per cent of oceans by 2030.",
    "Adequate management of such protected areas will be crucial to realize conservation benefits.",
    "Implementing sustainable fishing practices, expanding marine protected areas to safeguard key biodiversity areas, increasing capacities to monitor ocean health and addressing the pollution that is choking waterways are key actions to address mounting concerns.",
    "The Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies entering into force as soon as possible is a priority.",
    "Increasing participation in the Agreement on Port State Measures to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is necessary.",
    "Adopting a global plastic pollution instrument is essential.",
    "Ensuring that the Agreement on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction enters into force as soon as possible is vital to ensure the long-term health and sustainability of oceans."
