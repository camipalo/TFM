    "Reaching the $100 billion climate finance goal is a milestone yet trillions are needed for national action plans",
    "Climate finance is crucial in backing global mitigation and adaptation efforts",
    "Developed countries committed to mobilize $100 billion annually in climate finance for developing countries by 2020 and through 2025",
    "The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports that the commitment was met for the first time in 2022",
    "Climate finance increased by 30 per cent from 2021 to reach $115.9 billion in 2022, with 60 per cent of the total allocated to mitigation",
    "Total adaptation finance rose to $32.4 billion from $10.1 billion in 2016",
    "The 2021 Glasgow Climate Pact urged developed nations to double adaptation finance to developing countries from 2019 levels by 2025",
    "Negotiations are under way to establish a new climate finance goal from 2025 onwards, starting from a floor of $100 billion annually, and taking into account developing countries’ needs and priorities",
    "The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) estimates that nearly $6 trillion is needed for developing countries’ climate action plans by 2030",
    "Climate records were shattered in 2023 as the climate crisis accelerated in real time",
    "Rising temperatures have not abated and global greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb",
    "Communities worldwide are suffering from extreme weather and increasingly frequent and more intense disasters, destroying lives and livelihoods daily",
    "Meanwhile, fossil fuel subsidies hit a record high",
    "All countries must urgently speed up economy-wide, low-carbon transformations to avoid escalating economic and social costs",
    "The upcoming 2025 cycle of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) presents a chance for ambitious climate action plans that drive economic and social progress",
    "These must have increased ambition to close implementation gaps, cover entire economies and all greenhouse gases, and align with the target of limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C",
    "The road map to halting warming at 1.5°C and avoiding the worst of climate chaos is clear but cannot afford any delays or half measures",
    "Drastic reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions must take place by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050",
    "Global greenhouse gas emissions reached a new record of 57.4 gigatons of CO2 equivalent, according to the United Nations Environment Programme’s Emissions Gap Report 2023",
    "About two thirds of emissions comprised CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes",
    "Except transportation, emissions from all major sectors have rebounded since the pandemic and now exceed 2019 levels",
    "The energy sector, responsible for 86 per cent of global CO2 emissions, remains the largest contributor, driven by the expansion of coal- and gas-fired power generation",
    "Governments plan to produce around 110 per cent more fossil fuels by 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C",
    "Keeping warming to 1.5°C calls for a 42 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, requiring an 8.7 per cent annual decline",
    "For a 2°C limit, a 28 per cent drop by 2030 is necessary or a 5.3 per cent annual decrease",
    "Current national policies set the world on track for warming of 3°C",
    "NDCs lower this to 2.5°C, while all net-zero pledges would put warming at 2°C, although these pledges are highly uncertain",
    "There is currently only a 14 per cent chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C, underscoring the urgency of immediate, accelerated action to significantly cut emissions this decade",
    "Fossil fuel subsidies reached a record high of $1.53 trillion in 2022, driven by rising energy prices post-pandemic and the impact of the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine",
    "Public funds shoring up the production and consumption of oil, coal and gas more than doubled between 2021 and 2022, and more than tripled from their 2015 levels",
    "Recorded disasters increased fivefold over the past 50 years, driven partly by human-induced climate change",
    "The number of persons affected by disasters per 100,000 population rose from 1,169 (2005–2014) to 1,980 (2013–2022), a 69 per cent increase",
    "Improved preparedness, including early warning systems and evacuation measures, have significantly reduced disaster mortality in recent years",
    "Global disaster mortality per 100,000 population dropped by 49 per cent, from 1.62 in 2005–2014 to 0.82 in 2013–2022"
