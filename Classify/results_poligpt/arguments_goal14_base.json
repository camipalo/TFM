    "Oceans face significant challenges from eutrophication, worsening acidification, declining fish stocks, rising temperatures and widespread pollution.",
    "Efforts to address these mounting concerns remain uneven.",
    "Comprehensive global action is under way, yet it must accelerate.",
    "Overfishing, pollution, climate change and poor management drive continued declines in fish stocks",
    "The sustainability of global fishery resources declined from 90.0 per cent in 1974 to 64.6 per cent in 2019 and further to 62.3 per cent in 2021.",
    "Effective fisheries management can possibly reverse these effects and lead to optimal stock levels while supporting global food security and coastal communities.",
    "Proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable and biologically unsustainable levels, 1974â€“2021",
    "The value added of fisheries and aquaculture rose by 10 per cent from 2019 to 2021.",
    "Sustaining economic dividends from fisheries, however, requires judicious fish stock management practices that prevent overexploitation and depletion.",
    "Global agreements could renew momentum to protect key biodiversity areas in the oceans",
    "As of May 2024, there are 18,200 marine protected areas and 199 other effective, area-based conservation measures covering over 29 million square kilometres or 8.12 per cent of the ocean.",
    "Record-high ocean temperatures have triggered a fourth global coral bleaching event",
    "Rising ocean temperatures are raising new concerns for coral reefs, which support a quarter of marine species, provide resources for hundreds of millions of people in coastal communities and generate trillions of dollars in revenue annually."
